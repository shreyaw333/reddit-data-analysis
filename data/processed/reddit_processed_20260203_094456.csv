1qoxwdt,State of the Subreddit (January 2027): Mods applications and rules updates,ketralnis,programming,2026-01-27T19:54:14,95,0.92,36,"tl;dr: mods applications and minor rules changes. Also it's 2026, lol.

Hello fellow programs!

It's been a while since I've [checked in](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) and I wanted to give an update on the state of affairs. I won't be able to reply to every single thing but I'll do my best.

# Mods applications

I know there's been some [frustration about moderation resources](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qni22q/meta_mods_when_will_you_get_on_top_of_the/) so first things first, I want to open up applications for new mods for r/programming. If you're interested please start by reading the [State of the Subreddit (May 2024)](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) post for the reasoning behind the current rulesets, then leave a comment below with the word ""application"" somewhere in it so that I can tell it apart from the memes. In there please give at least:

- Why you want to be a mod
- Your favourite/least favourite kinds of programming content here or anywhere else
- What you'd change about the subreddit if you had a magic wand, ignoring feasibility
- Reddit experience (new user, 10 year veteran, spez himself) and moderation experience if any

I'm looking to pick up 10-20 new mods if possible, and then I'll be looking to them to first help clean the place up (mainly just keeping the new page free of rule-breaking content) and then for feedback on changes that we could start making to the rules and content mix. I've been procrastinating this for a while so wish me luck. We'll probably make some mistakes at first so try to give us the benefit of the doubt.

# Rules update

Not much is changing about the rules since [last time](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1chs4ib/the_state_of_the_subreddit_may_2024/) except for a few things, most of which I said last time I was keeping an eye on

- 🚫 **Generic AI content** that has nothing to do with programming. It's gotten out of hand and our users hate it. I thought it was a brief fad but it's been 2 years and it's still going.
- 🚫 **Newsletters** I tried to work with the frequent fliers for these and literally zero of them even responded to me so we're just going to do away with the category
- 🚫 ""**I made this**"", previously called demos with code. These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo. It was previously allowed when it was at least a GitHub link because sometimes people discussed the technical details of the code on display but these days even the code dumps are just people showing off something they worked on. That's cool, but it's not programming content.

## The rules!

With all of that, here is the current set of the rules with the above changes included so I can link to them all in one place.

✅ means that it's currently allowed, 🚫 means that it's not currently allowed, ⚠️ means that we leave it up if it is already popular but if we catch it young in its life we do try to remove it early, 👀 means that I'm not making a ruling on it today but it's a category we're keeping an eye on

* ✅ Actual programming content. They probably have actual code in them. Language or library writeups, papers, technology descriptions. How an allocator works. How my new fancy allocator I just wrote works. How our startup built our Frobnicator. For many years this was the only category of allowed content.
* ✅ Academic CS or programming papers
* ✅ Programming news. ChatGPT can write code. A big new CVE just dropped. Curl 8.01 released now with Coffee over IP support.
* ✅ Programmer career content. How to become a Staff engineer in 30 days. Habits of the best engineering managers. These must be related or specific to programming/software engineering careers in some way
* ✅ Articles/news interesting *to* programmers but not about programming. Work from home is bullshit. Return to office is bullshit. There's a Steam sale on programming games. Terry Davis has died. How to SCRUMM. App Store commissions are going up. How to hire a more diverse development team. Interviewing programmers is broken.
* ⚠️ General technology news. Google buys its last competitor. A self driving car hit a pedestrian. Twitter is collapsing. Oculus accidentally showed your grandmother a penis. Github sued when Copilot produces the complete works of Harry Potter in a code comment. Meta cancels work from home. Gnome dropped a feature I like. How to run Stable Diffusion to generate pictures of, uh, cats, yeah it's definitely just for cats. A bitcoin VR metaversed my AI and now my app store is mobile social local.
* 🚫 Anything clearly written mostly by an LLM. If you don't want to write it, we don't want to read it.
* 🚫 Politics. The Pirate Party is winning in Sweden. Please vote for net neutrality. Big Tech is being sued in Europe for *gestures broadly*. Grace Hopper Conference is now 60% male.
* 🚫 Gossip. Richard Stallman switches to Windows. Elon Musk farted. Linus Torvalds was a poopy-head on a mailing list. The People's Rust Foundation is arguing with the Rust Foundation For The People. Terraform has been forked into Terra and Form. Stack Overflow sucks now. Stack Overflow is good actually.
* 🚫 Generic AI content that has nothing to do with programming. It's gotten out of hand and our users hate it.
* 🚫 Newsletters, Listicles or anything else that just aggregates other content. If you found 15 open source projects that will blow my mind, post those 15 projects instead and we'll be the judge of that.
* 🚫 Demos without code. I wrote a game, come buy it! Please give me feedback on my startup (totally not an ad nosirree). I stayed up all night writing a commercial text editor, here's the pricing page. I made a DALL-E image generator. I made the fifteenth animation of A* this week, here's a GIF.
* 🚫 Project demos, ""I made this"". Previously called demos with code. These are generally either a blatant ad for a product or are just a bare link to a GitHub repo. 
* ✅ Project technical writups. ""I made this _and here's how_"". As said above, true technical writeups of a codebase or demonstrations of a technique or samples of interesting code in the wild are absolutely welcome and encouraged. All links to projects must include what makes them technically interesting, not just what they do or a feature list or that you spent all night making it. The technical writeup must be the _focus_ of the post, not just a tickbox checking exercise to get us to allow it. This is a technical subreddit, not Product Hunt. We don't care what you built, we care _how_ you build it.
* 🚫 AskReddit type forum questions. What's your favourite programming language? Tabs or spaces? Does anyone else hate it when.
* 🚫 Support questions. How do I write a web crawler? How do I get into programming? Where's my missing semicolon? Please do this obvious homework problem for me. Personally I feel very strongly about not allowing these because they'd quickly drown out all of the actual content I come to see, and there are already much more effective places to get them answered anyway. In real life the quality of the ones that we see is also universally very low.
* 🚫 Surveys and 🚫 Job postings and anything else that is looking to extract value from a place a lot of programmers hang out without contributing anything itself.
* 🚫 Meta posts. DAE think r/programming sucks? Why did you remove my post? Why did you ban this user that is totes not me I swear I'm just asking questions. Except this meta post. This one is okay because I'm a tyrant that the rules don't apply to (I assume you are saying about me to yourself right now).
* 🚫 Images, memes, anything low-effort or low-content. Thankfully we very rarely see any of this so there's not much to remove but like support questions once you have a few of these they tend to totally take over because it's easier to make a meme than to write a paper and also easier to vote on a meme than to read a paper.
* ⚠️ Posts that we'd normally allow but that are obviously, unquestioningly super low quality like blogspam copy-pasted onto a site with a bazillion ads. It has to be pretty bad before we remove it and even then sometimes these are the first post to get traction about a news event so we leave them up if they're the best discussion going on about the news event. There's a lot of grey area here with CVE announcements in particular: there are a lot of spammy security ""blogs"" that syndicate stories like this.
* ⚠️ Extreme beginner content. What is a variable. What is a `for` loop. Making an HTPT request using curl. Like listicles this is disallowed because of the quality typical to them, but high quality tutorials are still allowed and actively encouraged.
* ⚠️ Posts that are duplicates of other posts or the same news event. We leave up either the first one or the healthiest discussion.
* ⚠️ Posts where the title editorialises too heavily or especially is a lie or conspiracy theory.
* Comments are only very loosely moderated and it's mostly 🚫 Bots of any kind (Beep boop you misspelled misspelled!) and 🚫 Incivility (You idiot, everybody knows that my favourite toy is better than your favourite toy.)
However the number of obvious GPT comment bots is rising and will quickly become untenable for the number of active moderators we have.
* 👀 vibe coding articles. ""I tried vibe coding you guys"" is apparently a hot topic right now. If they're contentless we'll try to be on them under the general quality rule but we're leaving them alone for now if they have anything to actually say. We're not explicitly banning the category but you are encouraged to vote on them as you see fit.
* 👀 Corporate blogs simply describing their product in the guise of ""what is an authorisation framework?"". Pretty much anything with a rocket ship emoji in it. Companies use their blogs as marketing, branding, and recruiting tools and that's okay when it's ""writing a good article will make people think of us"" but it doesn't go here if it's just a literal advert. Usually they are titled in a way that I don't spot them until somebody reports it or mentions it in the comments.

r/programming's **mission** is to **be the place with the highest quality programming content, where I can go to read something interesting and learn something new every day**.

_In general_ rule-following posts will stay up, even if subjectively they aren't that great. We want to default to allowing things rather than intervening on quality grounds (except LLM output, etc) and let the votes take over. On r/programming the voting arrows mean ""show me more like this"". We use them to drive rules changes. So **please, vote away**. Because of this we're not especially worried about categories just because they have a lot of very low-scoring posts that sit at the bottom of the hot page and are never seen by anybody. If you've scrolled that far it's because you went through the higher-scoring stuff already and we'd rather show you that than show you nothing. On the other hand sometimes rule-breaking posts aren't obvious from just the title so also **don't be shy about reporting** rule-breaking content when you see it. Try to leave some context in the report reason: a lot of spammers report everything else to drown out the spam reports on their stuff, so the presence of one or two reports is often not enough to alert us since sometimes everything is reported.

There's an unspoken metarule here that the other rules are built on which is that all content should point ""outward"". That is, it should provide more value to the community than it provides to the poster. Anything that's looking to extract value from the community rather than provide it is disallowed even without an explicit rule about it. This is what drives the prohibition on job postings, surveys, ""feedback"" requests, and partly on support questions.

Another important metarule is that mechanically it's not easy for a subreddit to say ""we'll allow 5% of the content to be support questions"". So for anything that we allow we must be aware of types of content that beget more of themselves. Allowing memes and CS student homework questions will pretty quickly turn the subreddit into _only_ memes and CS student homework questions, leaving no room for the subreddit's actual mission.",https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1qoxwdt/state_of_the_subreddit_january_2027_mods/,,True,0,False,131,0.10523229532898042,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-27 19:54:14,19,Tuesday
1qusibj,Local tunnels - how to access remote SSH server behind NAT,Wild_Gold1045,programming,2026-02-03T07:53:40,19,0.73,15,"If you ever struggled accessing remove servers/machines located behind the NAT or with strict firewall rules (that does not allow inbound connections) then read this guide.   
  
Local tunneling is a networking technique that creates a virtual tunnel to a remote service through edge nodes which are acting as a public reverse proxy.   


with a single command it's possible to expose your SSH server to public internet:

`portbuddy tcp 22`  
   
if your machine acting as a jump box, you can do something like:

`portbuddy tcp` `192.168.1.13:22`

portbuddy tool will give you a public address like: net-proxy.eu.portbuddy.dev:40536

public address is going to be reserved to your account and won't change over time. So you can have persistent tunnel. 

You can also setup it as a linux service to keep it running after failure or reboot. 

To connect to your SSH server, use the following command:

`ssh -i {path to key}` `user@net-proxy.eu.portbuddy.dev` `-p 40536`",https://github.com/amak-tech/port-buddy,,False,0,False,34,-0.08165266106442577,neutral,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-02-03 07:53:40,7,Tuesday

1qu6t8s,Your Career Ladder is Rewarding the Wrong Behavior,3sc2002,programming,2026-02-02T14:34:57,334,0.84,77,"Every engineering organization has a hero.

They are the firefighter. The one who thrives under pressure, who can dive into a production-down incident at 3 AM and, through a combination of deep system knowledge and sheer brilliance, bring the system back to life. They are rewarded for it. They get the bonuses, the promotions, and the reputation as a ""go-to"" person.

And in celebrating them, we are creating a culture that is destined to remain on fire.

For every visible firefighter, there is an invisible fire preventer. This is the engineer who spends a month on a thankless, complex refactoring of a legacy service. Their work doesn't result in a new feature on the roadmap. Their success is silent—it's the catastrophic outage that doesn't happen six months from now. Their reward is to be overlooked in the next promotion cycle because their ""impact"" wasn't as visible as the hero who saved the day.

This is a perverse incentive, and we, as managers, created it.

Our performance review systems are fundamentally biased towards visible, reactive work over invisible, proactive work. We are great at measuring things we can easily count: features shipped, tickets closed, incidents resolved. We don't have a column on our spreadsheet for ""catastrophes averted."" As a result, we create a career ladder that implicitly encourages engineers to let things smolder, knowing the reward for putting out the eventual blaze is greater than the reward for ensuring there's no fire in the first place.

It's time to change what we measure. ""Impact"" cannot be a synonym for ""visible activity."" Real impact is the verifiable elimination of future work and risk.

* The engineer who automates a flaky, manual deployment step hasn't just closed a ticket; they have verifiably improved the Lead Time for Changes for every single developer on the team, forever. That is massive, compounding impact.
* The engineer who refactors a high-churn, bug-prone module hasn't just ""cleaned up code""; they have measurably reduced the Change Failure Rate for an entire domain of the business. That is a direct reduction in business risk.

We need to start rewarding the architects of fireproof buildings, not just the most skilled firefighters. This requires a conscious, data-driven effort to find and celebrate the invisible work. It means using tools that can quantify the risk of a module before it fails, and then tracking the reduction of that risk as a first-class measure of an engineer's contribution.

So the question to ask yourself in your next performance calibration is a hard one: Are we promoting the people who are best at navigating our broken system, or are we promoting the people who are actually fixing it?",https://blog.3squaredcircles.com,,False,0,False,411,0.10124797077922078,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-02-02 14:34:57,14,Monday

“It works…but what’s actually happening under the hood?” 🤔  
I recently deep-dived into Redis caching and broke it down from first principles:  
\- What Redis really stores (spoiler: it’s bytes, not JSON)  
\- How Java objects become cache entries  
\- The real role of serializers and ObjectMapper  
\- Why cache hits are fast and cache misses aren’t  
\- How Spring Cache ties everything together  
Instead of just configuration snippets, I focused on how data actually flows:  
Java Object → JSON → Bytes → Redis → Bytes → JSON → Java Object  
If you’ve ever struggled to explain Redis caching clearly to teammates, juniors, or even in interviews - this one’s for you.

Role assignment is similar to **annotations**: it changes behavior

1qu94m2,[Humor] A Field Guide to the Wildly Inaccurate Story Point,3sc2002,programming,2026-02-02T15:59:30,0,0.43,2,"Here, on the vast plains of the Q3 roadmap, a remarkable ritual is about to unfold. The engineering tribe has gathered around the glow of the digital watering hole for the ceremony known as Sprint Planning. It is here that we can observe one of the most mysterious and misunderstood creatures in the entire corporate ecosystem: the Story Point.

 For decades, management scientists have mistaken this complex organism for a simple unit of time or effort. This is a grave error. The Story Point is not a number; it is a complex social signal, a display of dominance, a cry for help, or a desperate act of camouflage.

 After years of careful observation, we have classified several distinct species.

 **1. The Optimistic Two-Pointer (Estimatus Minimus)**

A small, deceptively placid creature, often identified by its deceptively simple ticket description. Its native call is, ""Oh, that's trivial, it's just a small UI tweak."" The Two-Pointer appears harmless, leading the tribe to believe it can be captured with minimal effort. However, it is the primary prey of the apex predator known as ""Unforeseen Complexity."" More often than not, the Two-Pointer reveals its true, monstrous form mid-sprint, devouring the hopes of the team and leaving behind a carcass of broken promises.

 **2. The Defensive Eight-Pointer (Fibonacci Maximus)**

This is not an estimate; it is a territorial display. The Eight-Pointer puffs up its chest, inflates its scope, and stands as a formidable warning to any Product Manager who might attempt to introduce scope creep. Its large size is a form of threat posturing, communicating not ""this will take a long time,"" but ""do not approach this ticket with your 'quick suggestions' or you will be gored."" It is a protective measure, evolved to defend a developer's most precious resource: their sanity.

 **3. The Ambiguous Five-Pointer (Puntus Medius)**

The chameleon of the estimation world. The Five-Pointer is the physical embodiment of a shrug. It is neither confidently small nor defensively large. It is a signal of pure, unadulterated uncertainty. A developer who offers a Five-Pointer is not providing an estimate; they are casting a vote for ""I have no idea, and I am afraid to commit."" It survives by blending into the middle of the backlog, hoping to be overlooked.

 **4. The Mythical One-Pointer (Unicornis Simplex)**

A legendary creature, whose existence is the subject of much debate among crypto-zoologists of Agile. Sightings are incredibly rare. The legend describes a task so perfectly understood, so devoid of hidden dependencies, and so utterly simple that it can be captured and completed in a single afternoon. Most senior engineers believe it to be a myth, a story told to junior developers to give them hope.

 **Conclusion:**

 Our research indicates that the Story Point has very little to do with the actual effort required to complete a task. It is a complex language of risk, fear, and social negotiation, practiced by a tribe that is being forced to navigate a dark, unmapped territory. The entire, elaborate ritual of estimation is a coping mechanism for a fundamental lack of visibility.

Everything is red, the site is slow, and you start thinking SEO is going to bury you.

Honestly, I was tired of reading 50-page guides that make it sound like you need to be a NASA engineer just to gain 3 points on your score.

So I decided to code something simple but insanely effective for webmasters. A tool where you paste your URL and, instead of just giving you a bad grade, it directly gives you the PHP/JS code to copy-paste to fix the issues.

It’s free, it’s practical, and it saves you from installing 15 plugins that end up slowing your site even more lol.

Why am I doing this? Because it’s my passion, and I want everyone to benefit from it. We all know a slow website can be disastrous for conversions, SEO, and more.

In practice, this often leads to unpredictable changes, lack of context, and hard-to-review diffs.

I’ve been experimenting with a different mental model:  
**what if LLM-assisted coding was forced through the same discipline we expect from human engineers?**

The approach I’m testing enforces a strict pipeline:

* Analyze the codebase before suggesting changes
* Produce an explicit plan
* Generate diffs instead of full files
* Validate changes with local tests

This constraint-first approach surfaced some interesting challenges:

* LLMs tend to skip planning unless explicitly forced
* Diff-based output drastically improves reviewability
* Validation steps change prompt incentives

I’m still exploring trade-offs, especially around UX and performance.

If you’re interested, the experimental implementation is here:

1qtfh1j,"`jsongrep` – Query JSON using regular expressions over paths, compiled to DFAs",fizzner,programming,2026-02-01T18:11:14,7,0.77,2,"I've been working on `jsongrep`, a CLI tool and library for querying JSON documents using **regular path expressions**. I wanted to share both the tool and some of the theory behind it.

# The idea

JSON documents are trees. `jsongrep` treats paths through this tree as strings over an alphabet of field names and array indices. Instead of writing imperative traversal code, you write a **regular expression** that describes which paths to match:

    $ echo '{""users"": [{""name"": ""Alice""}, {""name"": ""Bob""}]}' | jg '**.name'
    [""Alice"", ""Bob""]

The `**` is a Kleene star—match zero or more edges. So `**.name` means ""find `name` at any depth.""

# How it works (the fun part)

The query engine compiles expressions through a classic automata pipeline:

1. **Parsing**: A PEG grammar (via `pest`) parses the query into an AST
2. **NFA construction**: The AST compiles to an epsilon-free NFA using [Glushkov's construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glushkov%27s_construction_algorithm): no epsilon transitions means no epsilon-closure overhead
3. **Determinization**: Subset construction converts the NFA to a DFA
4. **Execution**: The DFA simulates against the JSON tree, collecting values at accepting states

The alphabet is query-dependent and finite. Field names become discrete symbols, and array indices get partitioned into disjoint ranges (so `[0]`, `[1:3]`, and `[*]` don't overlap). This keeps the DFA transition table compact.

    Query: foo[0].bar.*.baz
    
    Alphabet: {foo, bar, baz, *, [0], [1..∞), ∅}
    DFA States: 6

# Query syntax

The grammar supports the standard regex operators, adapted for tree paths:

|Operator|Example|Meaning|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Sequence|`foo.bar`|Concatenation|
|Disjunction|`foo | bar`|Union|
|Kleene star|`**`|Any path (zero or more steps)|
|Repetition|`foo*`|Repeat field zero or more times|
|Wildcard|`*`, `[*]`|Any field / any index|
|Optional|`foo?`|Match if exists|
|Ranges|`[1:3]`|Array slice|

# Code structure

* `src/query/grammar/query.pest` – PEG grammar
* `src/query/nfa.rs` – Glushkov NFA construction
* `src/query/dfa.rs` – Subset construction + DFA simulation
* Uses `serde_json::Value` directly (no custom JSON type)

# Experimental: regex field matching

The grammar supports `/regex/` syntax for matching field names by pattern, but full implementation is blocked on an interesting problem: determinizing overlapping regexes requires subset construction across multiple regex NFAs simultaneously. If anyone has pointers to literature on this, I'd love to hear about it.

# vs jq

`jq` is more powerful ([it's Turing-complete](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28299366)), but for pure extraction tasks, `jsongrep` offers a more declarative syntax. You say *what* to match, not *how* to traverse.

1qtsqms,Blazor components inside XAML [OpenSilver 3.3] (looking for feedback),Userware,programming,2026-02-02T05:38:56,0,0.22,0,"Hi everyone,

We just released OpenSilver 3.3, and the headline feature is native Blazor integration: you can now embed any Blazor component directly inside XAML applications.

What this unlocks:

\-   Use DevExpress, Syncfusion, MudBlazor, Radzen, Blazorise, or any Blazor component library in your XAML app

\-   No JavaScript bridges or wrappers: both XAML and Blazor render to the DOM, so they share the same runtime

\-   Your ViewModels and MVVM architecture stay exactly the same

\-   Works with MAUI Hybrid too, so the same XAML+Razor code runs on Web, iOS, Android, Windows, and macOS

How it works:

You can either write Razor inline inside XAML (useful for quick integrations):

<StackPanel>

   <razor:RazorComponent>

@using Radzen

@using Radzen.Blazor

<RadzenButton Text=""Click me!"" Click=""{Binding OnClick, Type=Action}"" />

   </razor:RazorComponent>

</StackPanel>

(XAML-style markup extensions, such as Binding and StaticResource, work directly inside inline Razor)

Or reference separate .razor files from your XAML.

When to use this versus plain Blazor:

If you're starting fresh and prefer Razor/HTML/CSS, plain Blazor is probably simpler. This is more useful if:

\-   You're migrating an existing WPF/Silverlight app and want to modernize controls incrementally

\-   Your team knows XAML well and you want to keep that workflow

\-   You want access to a drag-and-drop designer (VS, VS Code, or online at https://xaml.io)

To try it:

\-   Live samples with source code: https://OpenSilverShowcase.com

\-   QuickStart GitHub repo with 6 examples: https://github.com/OpenSilver/OpenSilver\_Blazor\_QuickStart

\-   Docs & limitations: https://doc.opensilver.net/documentation/general/opensilver-blazor.html

It's open source (MIT). The team behind OpenSilver also offers migration services for teams with larger WPF/Silverlight codebases.

Curious to hear your thoughts: Would you use this for new projects, for modernizing legacy apps, or not at all? What would make it more useful? Any Blazor component libraries you'd want to see showcased?

They are about identity. We shape and reinforce it over a lifetime. It becomes our strongest armor - and, just as often, our hardest cage.

1qtgt62,What schema validation misses: tracking response structure drift in MCP servers,CrunchatizeYou,programming,2026-02-01T19:08:55,0,0.17,3,"Last year I spent a lot of time debugging why AI agent workflows would randomly break. The tools were returning valid responses - no errors, schema validation passing, but the agents would start hallucinating or making wrong decisions downstream.

The cause was almost always a subtle change in response *structure* that didn't violate any schema.

# The problem with schema-only validation

Tools like [Specmatic MCP Auto-Test](https://specmatic.io/updates/testing-mcp-servers-how-specmatic-mcp-auto-test-catches-schema-drift-and-automates-regression/) do a good job catching schema-implementation mismatches, like when a server treats a field as required but the schema says optional.

But they don't catch:

* A tool that used to return `{items: [...], total: 42}` now returns `[...]`
* A field that was always present is now sometimes entirely missing
* An array that contained homogeneous objects now contains mixed types
* Error messages that changed structure (your agent's error handling breaks)

All of these can be ""schema-valid"" while completely breaking downstream consumers.

# Response structure fingerprinting

When I built [Bellwether](https://github.com/dotsetlabs/bellwether), I wanted to solve this specific problem. The core idea is:

1. Call each tool with deterministic test inputs
2. Extract the *structure* of the response (keys, types, nesting depth, array homogeneity), not the values
3. Hash that structure
4. Compare against previous runs

&#8203;

    # First run: creates baseline
    bellwether check
    
    # Later: detects structural changes
    bellwether check --fail-on-drift

If a tool's response structure changes - even if it's still ""valid"" - you get a diff:

    Tool: search_documents
      Response structure changed:
        Before: object with fields [items, total, page]
        After: array
        Severity: BREAKING

This is 100% deterministic with no LLM, runs in seconds, and works in CI.

# What else this enables

Once you're fingerprinting responses, you can track other behavioral drift:

* **Error pattern changes**: New error categories appearing, old ones disappearing
* **Performance regression**: P50/P95 latency tracking with statistical confidence
* **Content type shifts**: Tool that returned JSON now returns markdown

The [June 2025 MCP spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/server/tools#output-schema) added Tool Output Schemas, which is great, but adoption is spotty, and even with declared output schemas, the actual structure can drift from what's declared.

# Real example that motivated this

I was using an MCP server that wrapped a search API. The tool's schema said it returned `{results: array}`. What actually happened:

* With results: `{results: [{...}, {...}], count: 2}`
* With no results: `{results: null}`
* With errors: `{error: ""rate limited""}`

All ""valid"" per a loose schema. But my agent expected to iterate over `results`, so `null` caused a crash, and the error case was never handled because the tool didn't return an MCP error, it returned a success with an error field.

Fingerprinting caught this immediately: ""response structure varies across calls (confidence: 0.4)"". That low consistency score was the signal something was wrong.

# How it compares to other tools

* **Specmatic**: Great for schema compliance. Doesn't track response structure over time.
* **MCP-Eval**: Uses semantic similarity (70% content, 30% structure) for trajectory comparison. Different goal - it's evaluating agent behavior, not server behavior.
* **MCP Inspector**: Manual/interactive. Good for debugging, not CI.

Bellwether is specifically for: did this MCP server's *actual behavior* change since last time?

# Questions

1. Has anyone else run into the ""valid but different"" response problem? Curious what workarounds you've used.
2. The MCP spec now has output schemas (since June 2025), but enforcement is optional. Should clients validate responses against output schemas by default?
3. For those running MCP servers in production, what's your testing strategy? Are you tracking behavioral consistency at all?

Sounds ominous right? Well, one of the biggest promoters of AI assisted coding has just put a stop to the hype and FOMO. Anthropic has published a paper that concludes:

\*  There is no significant speed up in development by using AI assisted coding. This is partly because composing prompts and giving context to the LLM takes a lot of time, sometimes comparable as writing the code manually.

\* AI assisted coding significantly lowers the comprehension of the codebase and impairs developers grow. Developers who rely more on AI perform worst at debugging, conceptual understanding and code reading.

This seems to contradict the massive push that has occurred in the last weeks, were people are saying that AI speeds them up massively(some claiming a 100x boost), that there is no downsides to this. Some even claim that they don't read the generated code and that software engineering is dead. Other people advocating this type of AI assisted development says ""You just have to review the generated code"" but it appears that just reviewing the code gives you at best a ""flimsy understanding"" of the codebase, which significantly reduces your ability to debug any problem that arises in the future, and stunts your abilities as a developer and problem solver, without delivering significant efficiency gains.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20245,,False,0,False,4508,0.08991071428571429,neutral,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-30 00:29:55,0,Friday

For example, robots could learn to follow lines, avoid obstacles, recognize objects, or make decisions in real time. Then we could organize competitions where robots race or complete tasks using the intelligence they’ve developed — not just pre-written code.
The idea is to make robotics more practical and fun. Students wouldn’t just assemble hardware; they would also train AI models, test strategies, and improve performance like a real-world engineering project. Think of it like Formula 1, but for AI-powered robots.
This could be great for schools, colleges, and tech institutes because it mixes coding, electronics, and problem-solving into one activity. It also encourages teamwork and innovation.

(2 YOE working in a startup, no coding)",No-System-2838,datascience,2026-01-31T20:19:48,33,0.85,9,"I’m looking for some career perspective and would really appreciate advice from people working in or around data science. 

I’m currently not sure where exactly is my career heading and want to start a business eventually in which I can use my data science skills as a tool, not forcefully but purposefully. 

Also my current job is giving me good experience of being in a startup environment where I’m able to learning to set up a manufacturing facility from scratch and able to first hand see business decisions and strategies. I also have some freedom to implement some of my ideas to improve or set new systems in the company and see it work eg. using m365 tools like sharepoint power automate power apps etc to create portals, apps and automation flows which collect data and I present that in meetings. But this involves no coding at all and very little implementation of what I learnt in school. 

Right now I’m struggling with a few questions:

1)Am I moving away from a real data science career, or building underrated foundations?

2)What does an actual data science role look like day-to-day in practice?

3)Is this kind of startup + tooling experience valuable, or will it hurt me later?

4)If my end goal is entrepreneurship + data, what skills should I be prioritizing now?

5)At what point should I consider switching roles or companies?

Recently, I tried to sit down and structure my thought about it from first principles.

It help me realized what actually is data cleaning, why it is often necessary and why it feels hard.

\- data cleaning is not about make data looks cleaner, it is fixing data to be closer to reality.

\- data cleaning is often necessary in data science when we work on new use cases, or simply because the data pipeline fail at some point.

\- data cleaning is hard because it often requires knowledge from other teams: business knowledge from operational team and system knowledge from IT team. This make it slow and painful particularly when those teams are not ready to support data science.

1qt2hhe,My thoughts on my recent interview experiences in tech,productanalyst9,datascience,2026-02-01T10:09:31,0,0.42,17,"Hi folks,

You might remember me from some of my previous posts in this subreddit about how to pass product analytics interviews in tech.

Well, it turns out I needed to take my own advice because I was laid off last year. I recently started interviewing and wanted to share my experience in case it’s helpful. I also share what I learned about salary and total compensation.

Note that this post is mostly about my experience trying to pass interviews, not about getting interviews.

# Context

* I’m a data scientist focused on product analytics in tech, targeting staff and lead level roles. This post won’t be very relevant to you if you’re more focused on machine learning, data engineering, or research
* I started applying on January 1st
* In the last two weeks, I had:
   * 6 recruiter calls
   * 4 tech screens
   * 2 hiring manager calls

Companies so far are a mix of MAANG, other large tech companies, and mid to late stage startups.

# Pipeline so far:

* 6 recruiter screens
* 5 moved me forward
* 4 tech screens, two hiring manager calls (1 hiring manager did not move me forward)
* I passed 2 tech screens, waiting to hear back from the other 2
* Right now I have two final rounds coming up. One with a MAANG and one with a startup.

# Recruiter Calls

The recruiter calls were all pretty similar. They asked me:

* About my background and experience
* One behavioral question (influencing roadmap, leading an AB test, etc.)
* What I’m looking for next
* Compensation expectations
* Work eligibility and remote or relocation preferences
* My timeline, where I am in the process with other companies
* They told me more about the company, role, and what the process looks like

**Here’s a tip about compensation:** I did my research so when they asked my compensation expectations, I told them a number that I thought would be on the high end of their band. But here's the tip: After sharing my number, I asked: “Is that in your range?”

Once they replied, I followed with: “What is the range, if you don’t mind me asking?”

2 out of 6 recruiters actually shared what typical offers look like!

A MAAANG company told me:

* Staff/Lead: 230k base, 390k total comp, 40k signing bonus
* Senior: 195k base, 280k total comp, 20k signing bonus

A late stage startup told me: 

* Staff/Lead: 235k base, 435k total comp
* Senior: 200k base, 315k total comp
* (I don’t know how they’re valuing their equity to come up with total comp)

# Tech Screens

I’ve done 4 tech screens so far. All were 45 to 60 minutes.

**SQL**

All four tested SQL. I used SQL daily at work, but I was rusty from not working for a while. I used [Stratascratch ](https://www.stratascratch.com/?via=productanalyst)to brush up. I did 5 questions per day for 10 days: 1 easy, 3 medium, 1 hard.

My rule of thumb for SQL is:

* Easy: 100% in under 3 minutes
* Medium: 100% in under 4 minutes
* Hard: \~80% in under 7 minutes

If you can do this, you can pass almost any SQL tech screen for product analytics roles.

**Case questions**

3 out of 4 tech screens had some type of case product question.

* Two were follow ups to the SQL. I was asked to interpret the results, explain what is happening, hypothesize why, where I would dig deeper, etc.
* One asked a standalone case: Is feature X better than feature Y? I had to define what “better” means, propose metrics, outline an AB test
* One showed me some statistical output and asked me to interpret it, what other data I would want to see, and recommend next steps. The output contained a bunch of descriptive data, a funnel analysis, and p-values

If you struggle with product sense, analytics case questions, and/or AB testing, there’s a lot of resources out there. Here’s what I used:

* [Here's a free framework and case study](https://medium.com/datainterview/principles-and-frameworks-of-product-metrics-youtube-case-study-ff63257a82d3)
* [Another framework guide](https://medium.com/data-science/the-ultimate-guide-to-cracking-business-case-interviews-for-data-scientists-part-1-cb768c37edf4)
* Watch mock interviews on Youtube
* If you’re willing to spend some money, [Ace the Data Science Interview ](https://amzn.to/4a9kzTE)has a few good chapters with common frameworks, and several practice cases with answers
* [Trustworthy Online Controlled Experiments](https://amzn.to/4qS2O2p) is the gold standard for AB testing

**Python**

Only one tech screen so far had a Python component, but another tech screen that I’m waiting to take has a Python component too. I don’t use Python much in my day to day work. I do my data wrangling in SQL and use Python just for statistical tests. And even when I did use Python, I’d lean on AI, so I’m weak on this part. Again, I used [Stratascratch ](https://www.stratascratch.com/?via=productanalyst)to prep. I usually do 5-10 questions a day. But I focused too much on manipulating data with Pandas.

The one Python tech screen I had tested on:

* Functions
* Loops
* List comprehension

I can’t do these from memory so I did not do well in the interview.

# Hiring Manager Calls

I had two of these. Some companies stick this step in between the recruiter screen and tech screen. 

I was asked about:

* Specific examples of influencing the roadmap
* Working with, and influencing leadership
* Most technical project I’ve worked on
* One case question about measuring the success of a feature
* What I’m looking for next

# Where I am now

* Two final rounds scheduled in the next 2-3 weeks
* Waiting to hear back from two tech screens

# Final thoughts

It feels like the current job market is much harder than when I was looking \~4 years ago. It’s harder to get interviews, and the tech screens are harder. When I was looking 4 years ago, I must have done 8 or 10 tech screens and they were purely SQL. Now, the tech screens might have a Python component and case questions.

The pay bands also seem lower or flat compared to 4 years ago. The Senior total comp at one MAANG is lower than what I was offered in 2022 as a Senior, and the Staff/Lead total comp is lower than what I was making as a Senior in big tech. 

I hope this was helpful. I plan to do another update after I do a few final loops.

1qrohou,Managers what's your LLM strategy?,testtestuser2,datascience,2026-01-30T19:24:03,27,0.74,24,"I'm a data science manager with a small team, so I've been interested in figuring out how to use more LLM magic to get my team some time back. 

Wondering what some common strategies are? 

The areas I've found challenges in are 

* documentation: we don't have enough detailed documentation readily available to plug in, so it's like a cold start problem. 

* validation: LLMs are so eager to spit out lines of code, so it writes 100 lines of code for the 20 lines of code it needed and reviewing it can be almost more effort than writing it yourself. 

* tools: either we give it something too generic and have to write a ton of documentation / best practice or we spend a ton of time structuring the tools to the point we lack any flexibility.

1qqtj9y,From Individual Contributor to Team Lead — what actually changes in how you create value?,Rich-Effect2152,datascience,2026-01-29T20:55:01,55,0.92,14,"I recently got promoted from individual contributor to data science team lead, and honestly I’m still trying to recalibrate how I should work and think.

As an IC, value creation was pretty straightforward: pick a problem, solve it well, ship something useful. If I did my part right, the value was there.

Now as a team lead, the bottleneck feels very different. It’s much more about judgment than execution:

* Is this problem even worth solving?
* Does it matter for the business or the system as a whole?
* Is it worth spending our limited time and people on it instead of something else?
* How do I get results *through* other people and through the organization, rather than by doing everything myself?

I find that being “technically right” is often not the hard part anymore. The harder part is deciding *what* to be right about, and *where* to apply effort.

For those of you who’ve made a similar transition:

* How did you train your sense of value judgment?
* How do you decide what *not* to work on?
* What helped you move from “doing good work yourself” to “creating leverage through others”?
* Any mental models, habits, or mistakes-you-learned-from that were particularly helpful?

1qhldsg,Using logistic regression to probabilistically audit customer–transformer matches (utility GIS / SAP / AMI data),Zestyclose_Candy6313,datascience,2026-01-19T18:06:17,12,1.0,8,"Hey everyone,

I’m currently working on a project using utility asset data (GIS / SAP / AMI) and I’m exploring whether this is a solid use case for introducing ML into a **customer-to-transformer matching audit** problem. The goal is to ensure that meters (each associated with a customer) are connected to the correct transformer.

# Important context

* Current customer → transformer associations are driven by a **location ID** containing circuit, address/road, and company (opco).
* After an initial analysis, some associations appear wrong, but **ground truth is partial** and validation is expensive (field work).
* The goal is **NOT** to auto-assign transformers.
* The goal is to **prioritize which existing matches are most likely wrong**.

I’m leaning toward framing this as a **probabilistic risk scoring** problem rather than a hard classification task, with something like **logistic regression** as a first model due to interpretability and governance needs.

# Initial checks / predictors under consideration

**1) Distance**

* Binary distance thresholds (e.g., >550 ft)
* Whether the assigned transformer is the **nearest** transformer
* Distance ratio: distance to assigned vs. nearest transformer (e.g., nearest is 10 ft away but assigned is 500 ft away)

**2) Voltage consistency**

* Identifying customers with similar service voltage
* Using voltage consistency as a signal to flag unlikely associations (challenging due to very high customer volume)

Model output to be: 

P(current customer → transformer match is wrong)



This probability would be used to define operational tiers (auto-safe, monitor, desktop review, field validation).

# Questions

1. Does **logistic regression** make sense as a first model for this type of probabilistic audit problem?
2. Any pitfalls when relying heavily on **distance + voltage** as primary predictors?
3. When people move beyond logistic regression here, is it usually **tree-based models + calibration**?
4. Any advice on **threshold / tier design** when labels are noisy and incomplete?",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1qhldsg/using_logistic_regression_to_probabilistically/,Projects,True,0,False,20,-0.04334666666666667,neutral,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-19 18:06:17,18,Monday
1qh0m1y,Which role better prepares you for AI/ML and algorithm design?,Huge-Leek844,datascience,2026-01-19T04:25:00,21,0.92,9,"Hi everyone,

I’m a perception engineer in automotive and joined a new team about 6 months ago. Since then, my work has been split between two very different worlds:

• Debugging nasty customer issues and weird edge cases in complex algorithms
• C++ development on embedded systems (bug fixes, small features, integrations)

Now my manager wants me to pick one path and specialize:

1. Customer support and deep analysis
   This is technically intense. I’m digging into edge cases, rare failures, and complex algorithm behavior. But most of the time I’m just tuning parameters, writing reports, and racing against brutal deadlines. Almost no real design or coding.

2. Customer projects
   More ownership and scope fewer fire drills. But a lot of it is integration work and following specs. Some algorithm implementation, but also the risk of spending months wiring things together.

Here’s the problem:
My long-term goal is AI/ML and algorithm design. I want to build systems, not just debug them or glue components together.

Right now, I’m worried about getting stuck in:

\* Support hell where I only troubleshoot
\* Or integration purgatory where I just implement specs

If you were in my shoes:

Which path actually helps you grow into AI/ML or algorithm roles?
What would you push your manager for to avoid career stagnation?

Any real-world advice would be hugely appreciated.

1qflxse,How the Kronecker product helped me get to benchmark performance.,vercig09,datascience,2026-01-17T13:10:03,49,0.88,21,"Hi everyone,

  
Recently had a common problem, where I had to improve the speed of my code 5x, to get to benchmark performance needed for production level code in my company.

Long story short, OCR model scans a document and the goal is to identify which file from the folder with 100,000 files the scan is referring to.

  
I used a bag-of-words approach, where 100,000 files were encoded as a sparse matrix using scipy. To prepare the matrix, CountVectorizer from scikit-learn was used, so I ended up with a 100,000 x 60,000 sparse matrix. 

To evaluate the number of shared words between the OCR results, and all files, there is a ""minimum"" method implemented, which performs element-wise minimum operation on matrices of the same shape. To use it, I had to convert the 1-dimensional vector encoding the word count in the new scan, to a huge matrix consisting of the same row 100,000 times.

One way to do it is to use the ""vstack"" from Scipy, but this turned out to be the bottleneck when I profiled the script. Got the feedback from the main engineer that it has to be below 100ms, and I was stuck at 250ms. 

Long story short, there is another way of creating a ""large"" sparse matrix with one row repeated, and that is to use the [kron](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.kron.html#scipy.sparse.kron) method (stands for ""Kronecker product""). After implementing, inference time got cut to 80ms. 

  
Of course, I left a lot of the details out because it would be too long, but the point is that a somewhat obscure fact from mathematics (I knew about the Kronecker product) got me the biggest performance boost.

A.I. was pretty useful, but on its own wasn't enough to get me down below 100ms, had to do old style programming!!

  
Anyway, thanks for reading. I posted this because first I wanted to ask for help how to improve performance, but I saw that the rules don't allow for that. So instead, I'm writing about a neat solution that I found.

I am about to finish the Georgia tech OMSCS program and am going to start looking for new positions relatively soon. I would like to find something outside of defense. However, given how often I see domain and industry knowledge heralded as this all important thing in posts here, I am under the impression that switching to a different industry or domain in DS is quite difficult. This is likely especially true in my case as going from government/contracting to the private sector is likely harder than the other way around.


As far as technical skills, I feel pretty confident in the standard python DS stack (numpy/pandas/matplotlib) as well as some of the ML/DL libraries (XGBoost/PyTorch) as I use them at work regularly. I also use SQL and other certain other things that come up on job ads such as git, Linux, and Apache Airflow. The main technical gap I feel that I have is that I don’t use cloud at all for my job but I am currently studying for one of the AWS certification exams so that should hopefully help at least a little bit. There are a couple other things here and there I should probably brush up on such as Spark and Docker/kubernetes but I do have basic knowledge of those things.

The main focus was solving the retraining bottleneck. By optimizing for **continual learning**, we’ve reduced training complexity from the typical O(n\^2) to O(n). In our current benchmarks, it’s outperforming AutoGluon on several standard tabular datasets: [https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual?tab=readme-ov-file#perpetualbooster-vs-autogluon](https://github.com/perpetual-ml/perpetual?tab=readme-ov-file#perpetualbooster-vs-autogluon)

We recently launched a managed environment to make this easier to operationalize:

* **Serverless Inference:** Endpoints that scale to zero (pay-per-execution).
* **Integrated Monitoring:** Automated data and concept drift detection that can natively trigger continual learning tasks.
* **Marimo Integration:** We use Marimo as the IDE for a more reproducible, reactive notebook experience compared to standard Jupyter.
* **Data Ops:** Built-in quality checks and 14+ native connectors to external sources.

What’s next:

We are currently working on expanding the platform to support LLM workloads. We’re in the process of adding NVIDIA Blackwell GPU support to the infrastructure for those needing high-compute training and inference for larger models.

* I've been focusing a lot on prompts, skills, subagents, MCP, and slash commands to speed up and improve workflows [similar to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2ciJedw2vU).

* Recently, I have been experimenting with [Claudish](https://github.com/MadAppGang/claudish), which allows for plugging any model into Claude Code. Also, I have been transitioning to use [Marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo) instead of Jupyter Notebooks.

Sometimes the AI model outputs great stuff, sometimes it outputs horrible stuff. I can't tell the difference, but the users (who are subject matter experts) can.

I have a lot of opinions about testing and how it should be done, which I've written about extensively (mostly in a RAG context) if you're curious.

\- [RAG evaluation](https://www.eyelevel.ai/post/how-to-test-rag-and-agents-in-the-real-world)

For the sake of this discussion, let's take for granted that you know what the actual problem is in your AI app (which is not trivial). There's another problem which we'll concern ourselves in this particular post. If you know what's wrong with your AI system, how do you make it better? That's the point, to discuss making maintainable AI systems.

I've been [bullish about AI agents for a while now](https://iaee.substack.com/p/the-future-is-agentic-5c644f6b8f5b), and it seems like the industry has come around to the idea. they can break down problems into sub-problems, ponder those sub-problems, and use external tooling to help them come up with answers. Most developers are familiar with the approach and understand its power, but I think many are under-appreciative of their drawbacks from a maintainability prospective.

When people discuss ""AI Agents"", I find they're typically referring to what I like to call an ""Unconstrained Agent"". When working with an unconstrained agent, you give it a query and some tools, and let it have at it. The agent thinks about your query, uses a tool, makes an observation on that tools output, thinks about the query some more, uses another tool, etc. This happens on repeat until the agent is done answering your question, at which point it outputs an answer. This was proposed in the landmark paper ""ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models"" which I discuss at length in [this article](https://iaee.substack.com/p/llm-agents-intuitively-and-exhaustively-explained-8905858e18e2?utm_source=publication-search). This is great, especially for open ended systems that answer open ended questions like ChatGPT or Google (I think this is more-or-less what's happening when ChatGPT ""thinks"" about your question, though It also probably does some reasoning model trickery, [a-la deepseek](https://iaee.substack.com/p/deepseek-r1-intuitively-and-exhaustively?utm_source=publication-search)). 

This unconstrained approach isn't so great, I've found, when you build an AI agent to do something specific and complicated. If you have some logical process that requires a list of steps and the agent messes up on step 7, it's hard to change the agent so it will be right on step 7, without messing up its performance on steps 1-6. It's hard because, the way you define these agents, you tell it how to behave, then it's up to the agent to progress through the steps on its own. Any time you modify the logic, you modify all steps, not just the one you want to improve. I've heard people use ""whack-a-mole"" when referring to the process of improving agents. This is a big reason why.

I call graph based agents ""constrained agents"", in contrast to the ""unconstrained agents"" we discussed previously. Constrained agents allow you to control the logical flow of the agent and its decision making process. You control each step and each decision independently, meaning you can add steps to the process as necessary.

[Imagine you developed a graph which used an LLM to introduce itself to the user, then progress to general questions around qualification \(1\). You might decide this is too simple, and opt to check the user's response to ensure that it does contain a name before progressing \(2\). Unexpectedly, maybe some of your users don’t provide their full name after you deploy this system to production. To solve this problem you might add a variety of checks around if the name is a full name, or if the user insists that the name they provided is their full name \(3\).](https://preview.redd.it/3ini75u95tbg1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7960052ed2df34afec0ee969d337b45e9a0a97)

[image source](https://iaee.substack.com/p/langgraph-intuitively-and-exhaustively?utm_source=publication-search)

This allows you to much more granularly control the agent at each individual step, adding additional granularity, specificity, edge cases, etc. This system is much, much more maintainable than unconstrained agents. I [talked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N59Z7uJ8DDA&t=444s) with some folks at [arize](https://arize.com/) a while back, a company focused on AI observability. Based on their experience at the time of the conversation, the vast amount of actually functional agentic implementations in real products tend to be of the constrained, rather than the unconstrained variety.

I think it's worth noting, these approaches aren't mutually exclusive. You can run a ReAct style agent within a node within a graph based agent, allowing you to allow the agent to function organically within the bounds of a subset of the larger problem. That's why, in my workflow, graph based agents are the first step in building any agentic AI system. They're more modular, more controllable, more flexible, and more explicit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1q64yb5/improvable_ai_a_breakdown_of_graph_based_agents/,Discussion,True,0,False,27,0.15262980898574116,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-06 21:51:12,21,Tuesday

1q4iro4,Distributed LightGBM on Azure SynapseML: scaling limits and alternatives?,ciaoshescu,datascience,2026-01-05T04:59:08,16,1.0,5,"I’m looking for advice on running LightGBM in true multi-node / distributed mode on Azure, given some concrete architectural constraints.

Current setup:

- Pipeline is implemented in Azure Databricks with Spark

- Feature engineering and orchestration are done in PySpark

- Model training uses LightGBM via SynapseML

- Training runs are batch, not streaming

Key constraint / problem:

- Current setup runs LightGBM on a single node (large VM)

Although the Spark cluster can scale, LightGBM itself remains single-node, which appears to be a limitation of SynapseML at the moment (there seems to be an open issue for multi-node support).

What I’m trying to understand:

Given an existing Databricks + Spark pipeline, what are viable ways to run LightGBM distributed across multiple nodes on Azure today?

Native LightGBM distributed mode (MPI / socket-based) on Databricks?

Any practical workarounds beyond SynapseML?

How do people approach this in Azure Machine Learning?

Custom training jobs with MPI?

Pros/cons compared to staying in Databricks?

Is AKS a realistic option for distributed LightGBM in production, or does the operational overhead outweigh the benefits?

From experience:

Where do scaling limits usually appear (networking, memory, coordination)?

At what point does distributed LightGBM stop being worth it compared to single-node + smarter parallelization?

* **LibreOffice-based**: 1GB+ container images, headless X11 setup
* **Apache Tika**: Java runtime, 500MB+ footprint
* **subprocess wrappers**: security concerns, platform issues

`sharepoint-to-text` parses Office binary formats (OLE2) and OOXML directly in Python. Zero system dependencies.

**What it handles:**

* Legacy Office: `.doc`, `.xls`, `.ppt`
* Modern Office: `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`
* OpenDocument: `.odt`, `.ods`, `.odp`
* PDF, Email (`.eml`, `.msg`, `.mbox`), HTML, plain text formats

**Basic usage:**

python

    import sharepoint2text
    
    result = next(sharepoint2text.read_file(""document.docx""))
    text = result.get_full_text()
    
    # Or iterate by page/slide/sheet for RAG chunking
    for unit in result.iterate_units():

Also extracts tables, images, and metadata. Has a CLI. JSON serialization built in.

**Install:** `uv add sharepoint-to-text` or `pip install sharepoint-to-text`

* No OCR - scanned PDFs return empty text
* Password-protected files are rejected
* Word docs don't have page boundaries (that's a format limitation, not ours)

1pu71am,Chemist Turned Data Scientist: Looking for Career Development Advice in Hybrid Roles,norfkens2,datascience,2025-12-23T16:28:20,40,0.94,16,"Hi everyone, 

I'm looking for advice on career development and would appreciate input from different perspectives - data professionals, managers, and chemist or folks from adjacent fields (if any frequent this subreddit).


**About me:**

- I'm a trained chemist and have been working as a data scientist for three years 

- my current role is a hybrid one: I generate business value from data through ad-hoc analyses, data sourcing, workflow optimisation and consulting.

- I typically work on chemical process optimisation but also on numeric problems in python, and recently started exploring LLMs (which has only a limited application to our work).

- I also manage projects and implement available tools that help teams work more efficiently.


**What I enjoy:**

- working with people to solve challenging problems 

- enabling others by providing better tools and processes

- stay technical enough to understand and contribute, but not going too deep into code or algorithms /every day/.


**Current observations:**

- the chemical industry is relatively conservative with lower digital maturity compared to other sectors. Certifications tend to be valued more than in pure data science environments (at least in Germany).

- my data science work is often basic - ML has only come up once in three years (in a very minor capacity)


**Areas I'm considering for development:**

- Numeric problem-solving

- Operations Research (I've started to learn but no certification yet) 

- Business intelligence / Analytical Operation (e.g. building better data pipelines to enable my coworkers; Snowflake want necessary yet, plus silos are a real challenge) 

- as a new area: possibly Supply Chain, as it seems relevant to my experience in manufacturing, chemical processes and quality support. 


**Questions for you:**

1) What certifications or skills would you recommend for someone in a chemistry + data hybrid role?

2) are there other areas in chemical or pharmaceutical companies where such a hybrid profile could add value?

3) how can I best identify roads or projects with strong overlap between chemistry and data science? 

4) from a management perspective, what qualities or experiences should I build now to prepare for leadership in this space?

5) any general advice on networking or positioning myself for the next step? 


I already hold a PhD, so I'm not looking for another degree - but I'm open to targeted certifications or practical learning paths.

Thanks in advance for your insights!

Would love to hear the subreddits thoughts on a move in this climate.

I currently work for a city as a Senior DS. The position has good WLB, early retirement healthcare (in 5 years), and relative security. However, my role has shifted to mostly reporting in Tableau and Excel with shrinking DS opportunities. There is no growth in terms of salary or position.

I have an offer from a mature startup that would give me a large pay bump and allow me to work on DS projects with a more contemporary tech stack. However, their reviews have mentioned recent layoffs and slow career growth.

Below are some more specifics:

I am 35 in a VHCOL city. DINK with a mortgage and student loans

Current Job: -$130k

* Okay pension with early retirement Healthcare in 5 years
* Good WLB, but non-DS work with an aging tech stack
* Raises and promotions are extremely rare (none for my team in the last 4 years)
* 2 days in office

New Job - same title:

* $170k
* DS work with a much more modern tech stack stack
* fully remote
* 1st year off 2 years of layoffs
* reviews frequently cite few raises and promotions; however, really good wlb.

One nice thing is I don't lose my pension progress if I leave, so if I do end up in a city or state position again I start up where I left off.

UPDATE: I've decided to go with the new place - with my reasoning below:

* Doing the math my pension benefit can be replicated with a 15% raise (less than the 30% the new role would give).
* Talked to the new hiring manager and learned some more about the volatility and needs of the team which alleviated some concerns.
* The holiday week at my current job has been very annoying. Like it has been doubling down on my concerns. This may be because I have an offer in my pocket, but they were particularly apparent in what should be a quieter week.

My biggest concern is giving up the higher stability, but the points below were pretty good at pointing out that I am likely overrating it (might have been a different story if I was in a union but I am at-will).

I expect just salary and bonus to be 143k then we add in the profit sharing, stocks and equity, rrsp contributions we expect the comp to push that generous number. Big retailer.

Currently i make 120.5k. Small niche fintech.

3 years of experience i perform as a DS but did a pretty good job in my current role and i do genuinely innovate. So i am also on track to be manager in my current role.

Type of work:
Retailer is a lot of causal inference. I have to manage 4 people eventually 6. Building team from scratch in a pressure cooker environment.

Fintech is a lot of credit risk and end to end ownership + docker + portfolio management + causal inference.

I am going to take it to my manager and see the offer on the table. My big boss is super generous so it’s not out of the table to get great salaries. Unprompted i got an offer from 102500 total to 120.5. So i am 100%.

Environment:
Big retailer: 4 days in office
Fintech: 2-3 days in offie probably 3  by next years.

People:
Big retailer: dont know but i go back to corporate.
Fintech: we do have a bunch of idiots in the company and execs are not really my favorite. I do like some of our senior leadership but the top exec other than 1 exec i dont really like them.


Career outlook: i came from original bank i had more interviews with big tech in the big bank than i did with fintech. Most of my interviews came from the fact i work in a big bank. So maybe going to big tech might be the play.

I am gunning for the big tech roles so i am pushing as much as possible to hit the 180-200k comps so i can then climb the ladder.

Do note for retailer I rejected their senior ds offer as it matched my comp. So they went in with manager and then svps sought me out. I interviewed and left a strong impression of how I explain + scope things as I do end to end ownership on my fintech role.


Career insight is appreciated.

The target is binary, but the model outputs a probability, and we use that probability as a continuous score for ranking rather than applying a hard threshold.

Imagine I have a backlog of items(samples) that need to be worked on by a team, and at any given moment I want to rank them by “probability of success”.

Assume historical target variable is “was this item successful”(binary) and 1 million rows historical data.

When an item first appears in the backlog(on Day 0), only partial information is available, so if I score it at that point, it might get a score of 0.6.

Over time(let’s say day 5), additional information about that same item becomes available (metadata is filled in, external inputs arrive, some fields flip from unknown to known). If I were to score the item again later(on day 5), the score might update to 0.7 or 0.8.

The important part is that the model is not trying to predict how the item evolves over time. Each score is meant to answer a static question:

“Given everything we know right now, how should this item be prioritized relative to the others?”

The system periodically re-scores items that haven’t been acted on yet and reorders the queue based on the latest scores.

DS succeeded in killing off a whole project just because he was so vehement that the SaaS was absolutely terrible and everybody just caved.  And now my boss - who doesn't know anything about this stuff - is considering cancelling the contract and getting ... some other SaaS that does the same things because we won't always have a DS available.

I don't know what to make of this.  Some fairly senior people were involved in the decision to get the SaaS so DS is basically implying they didn't do their jobs properly.  Also it just seemed weird, to be so publicly semi-enraged about such a thing.  

I quietly did my own little side-by-side comparison of the SaaS outputs and those from the DS's work and the SaaS seemed to do OK, for the fairly straightforward task we were doing.  I haven't dared tell anyone I did this in case it gets back to DS.

1prs5fg,New Data Science Team Lead struggling with aggressive PM on timelines and model expectations,Rich-Effect2152,datascience,2025-12-20T17:44:23,136,0.98,35,"I’m a data scientist who was recently promoted to be a data science team lead. Overall I enjoy the role, but I’m running into a recurring challenge with a very aggressive product manager (also a leader) that I’m not sure how to handle well yet.

There are two main issues:

**1. Project timelines**

Whenever we plan a project, she strongly questions why the data science timeline is “so long.”  
From my perspective, the timeline reflects real uncertainties: data quality issues, iteration cycles, experimentation, validation, and sometimes dependency on upstream systems. But in discussions, it often turns into “why can’t this be done faster?” rather than a conversation about trade-offs or risk.

**2. Model performance expectations**

She also frequently questions why the model performance “isn’t better.”  
Even when we’ve already applied reasonable feature engineering, tried multiple models, and are close to what I believe is the practical upper bound given the data, the response is often “can’t we push it further?” without a clear cost-benefit discussion.

I understand that pushing for faster delivery and better results is part of a PM’s job. I’m not against being challenged. But I’m struggling with:

* How to defend timelines without sounding defensive
* How to explain model limitations in a way that’s convincing to non-technical stakeholders
* How to avoid these conversations becoming emotionally charged or unproductive
* How much of this is “normal PM behavior” vs. something I should actively push back on as a DS lead

For those of you who’ve been senior ICs, DS managers, or team leads:

* How do you handle PMs who are very aggressive on timelines and metrics?
* What frameworks or language have you found effective when explaining uncertainty and diminishing returns?
* At what point do you escalate, and how?

Any advice, examples, or even “this is normal, here’s how to survive it” stories would be greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1prs5fg/new_data_science_team_lead_struggling_with/,Discussion,True,0,False,171,0.17079414838035528,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2025-12-20 17:44:23,17,Saturday

1ppgky6,Open Source: datasetiq: Python client for millions of economic datasets – pandas-ready,dsptl,datascience,2025-12-17T21:26:09,37,0.91,6,"Datasetiq is a lightweight Python library that lets you fetch and work millions of global economic time series from trusted sources like FRED, IMF, World Bank, OECD, BLS, US Census, and more. It returns clean pandas DataFrames instantly, with built-in caching, async support, and simple configuration—perfect for macro analysis, econometrics, or quick prototyping in Jupyter.

Python is central here: the library is built on pandas for seamless data handling, async for efficient batch requests, and integrates with plotting tools like matplotlib/seaborn.

\### Target Audience

Primarily aimed at economists, data analysts, researchers, macro hedge funds, central banks, and anyone doing data-driven macro work. It's production-ready (with caching and error handling) but also great for hobbyists or students exploring economic datasets. Free tier available for personal use.

\### Comparison

Unlike general API wrappers (e.g., fredapi or pandas-datareader), datasetiq unifies multiple sources (FRED + IMF + World Bank + 9+ others) under one simple interface, adds smart caching to avoid rate limits, and focuses on macro/global intelligence with pandas-first design. It's more specialized than broad data tools like yfinance or quandl, but easier to use for time-series heavy workflows.

\### Quick Example

`pip install datasetiq`



    import datasetiq as iq
    
    # Set your API key (one-time setup)
    iq.set_api_key(""your_api_key_here"")
    
    # Get data as pandas DataFrame
    df = iq.get(""FRED/CPIAUCSL"")
    
    # Display first few rows
    print(df.head())
    
    # Basic analysis

1quehcc,"[D] Where is modern geometry actually useful in machine learning? (data, architectures, optimization)",ternausX,MachineLearning,2026-02-02T19:36:24,55,0.89,16,"**From April 2025 to January 2026, I worked through** [**Frankel’s ""The Geometry of Physics"".**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294139.The_Geometry_of_Physics)

The goal wasn’t to “relearn physics”, but to rebuild a modern geometric toolbox and see which mature ideas from geometry and topology might still be underused in machine learning.

The book develops a large amount of machinery—manifolds, differential forms, connections and curvature, Lie groups and algebras, bundles, gauge theory, variational principles, topology—and shows how these arise naturally across classical mechanics, electromagnetism, relativity, and quantum theory.

A pattern that kept reappearing was:

**structure → symmetry → invariance → dynamics → observables**

Physics was forced into coordinate-free and global formulations because local, naive approaches stopped working. In ML, we often encounter similar issues—parameters with symmetries, non-Euclidean spaces, data living on manifolds, generalization effects that feel global rather than local—but we usually address them heuristically rather than structurally.

I’m not claiming that abstract math automatically leads to better models. Most ideas don’t survive contact with practice. But when some do, they often enable qualitatively different behavior rather than incremental improvements.

I’m now trying to move closer to ML-adjacent geometry: geometric deep learning beyond graphs, Riemannian optimization, symmetry and equivariance, topology-aware learning.

I’d be very interested in pointers to work (books, lecture notes, papers, or practical case studies) that sits between **modern geometry/topology and modern ML**, especially answers to questions like:

* which geometric ideas have actually influenced model or optimizer design beyond toy settings?
* where does Riemannian or manifold-aware optimization help in practice, and where is it mostly cosmetic?
* which topological ideas seem fundamentally incompatible with SGD-style training?

We just released v1.1.2 of PerpetualBooster. For those who haven't seen it, it's a gradient boosting machine (GBM) written in Rust that eliminates the need for hyperparameter optimization by using a generalization algorithm controlled by a single ""budget"" parameter.

This update focuses on performance, stability, and ecosystem integration.

Key Technical Updates:
- Performance: up to 2x faster training.
- Ecosystem: Full R release, ONNX support, and native ""Save as XGBoost"" for interoperability.
- Python Support: Added Python 3.14, dropped 3.9.
- Data Handling: Zero-copy Polars support (no memory overhead).
- API Stability: v1.0.0 is now the baseline, with guaranteed backward compatibility for all 1.x.x releases (compatible back to v0.10.0).

Benchmarking against LightGBM + Optuna typically shows a 100x wall-time speedup to reach the same accuracy since it hits the result in a single run.

One of the biggest pains in mobile ML deployment is that your trained model usually sits unencrypted in the APK. If you spent $50k fine-tuning a model, that's a liability.

I open-sourced a tool called **TensorSeal** that handles the encryption/decryption pipeline for Android.

It ensures the model is only decrypted in memory (RAM) right before inference, keeping the disk footprint encrypted. It uses the TFLite C API to load directly from the buffer.

1qusm4q,[D]KL Divergence is not a distance metric. It’s a measure of inefficiency. (Derivations + Variance Reduction),Illustrious-Cat-4792,MachineLearning,2026-02-03T07:58:07,0,0.41,3,"I recently decided to stop treating KL Divergence as a ""black box"" distance metric and actually derive it from first principles to understand why it behaves the way it does in optimization.

I found that the standard intuition (""it measures distance between distributions"") often hides the actual geometry of what's happening during training. I wrote a deep dive article about this, but I wanted to share the two biggest ""Aha!!!!!!"" moments here directly.

The optimization geometry (forward vs. reverse): The asymmetry of KL is not just a mathematical quirk. it dictates whether your model spreads out or collapses.  
  
\- Forward KL (D\_KL​(P∣∣Q))**:** This is **Zero-Avoiding**. The expectation is over the true data P. If P(x) >0 and your model Q(x) -> 0, the penalty explodes.

*Result:* Your model is forced to stretch and cover *every* mode of the data (Mean-Seeking). This is why MLE works for classification but can lead to blurry images in generation.  
  
**-** Reverse KL (D\_KL​(Q∣∣P))**:** This is **Zero-Forcing**. The expectation is over your model Q. If P(x)≈0, your model *must* be 0. But if your model ignores a mode of P entirely? Zero penalty.

  
*Result:* Your model latches onto the single easiest mode and ignores the rest (Mode-Seeking). This is the core reason behind ""Mode Collapse"" in GANs/Variational Inference.

The Variance Trap & The Fix: If you try to estimate KL via naive Monte Carlo sampling, you’ll often get massive variance.

D\_KL​≈1/N ​∑ log P(x)/Q(x)​

The issue is the ratio P/Q. In the tails where Q underestimates P, this ratio explodes, causing gradient spikes that destabilize training.

  
The Fix (Control Variates): It turns out there is a ""natural"" control variate hiding in the math. Since E​\[Q/P\]=1, the term (Q/P−1) has an expected value of 0. Subtracting this term from your estimator cancels out the first-order Taylor expansion of the noise. It stabilizes the gradients without introducing bias.

* Separates intent decomposition from execution (compiler ≠ agent runtime)
* Enforces structure, boundaries, and contracts instead of relying on prompt “behavior”

What it explicitly does *not* do:

* No tool calling
* No auto-execution
* No workflow orchestration
* No claim of autonomy or AGI

Why this was non-trivial:  
Most prompt or agent systems conflate:

* intent
* planning
* execution
* memory
* orchestration

This compiler isolates just one layer: **intent → structured specification**, similar to how compilers isolate syntax/semantics from runtime.

The hard part wasn’t generating text, but enforcing:

* stable schemas
* bounded outputs
* replayable structure
* separation between human intent and agent behavior

Example domains it currently compiles:

* landing pages
* MVP builders
* research agents
* planners
* domain-specific task agents

Everything is OSS and runnable inside a normal chat environment. You paste the compiler spec once, then feed it short intents.

* failure modes you see in intent normalization

1qtqq4s,[P] Recommended tech stack for a web-based document OCR system (React/Next.js + FastAPI?),Sudden_Breakfast_358,MachineLearning,2026-02-02T03:43:07,1,0.55,8,"I’m designing a **web-based document OCR system** and would like advice on the appropriate **frontend, backend, database, and deployment setup**.

The system will be hosted and will support **two user roles**: a general user who uploads documents and reviews OCR results, and an admin who manages users and documents.

There are **five document types**. Two document types have varying layouts, but I only need to OCR the person’s name and the document type so it can be matched to the uploader. One document type follows a two-column key–value format such as `First Name: John`. For this type, I need to OCR both the field label and its value, then allow the user to manually correct the OCR result if it is inaccurate. The remaining document types follow similar structured patterns.

For the **frontend**, I am most familiar with React.js and Next.js. I prefer using **React.js with shadcn/ui** for building the UI and handling user interactions such as file uploads and OCR result editing.

For the **backend**, I am considering **FastAPI** to handle authentication, file uploads, OCR processing, and APIs. For my OCR, I am thinking of using **PaddleOCR**  but I am also open to other recommendations. And also searching for other OCR tools for my usecase.

My main questions are:

* Is React.js with shadcn/ui a good choice for this type of application, or would Next.js provide meaningful advantages?
* Is FastAPI suitable for an OCR-heavy workflow that includes file uploads and asynchronous processing?
* Are there known deployment or scaling issues when using **Next.js (or React)** together with **FastAPI**?
* What type of database would be recommended for storing users, document metadata, OCR results, and corrected values?

I’m trying to avoid architectural decisions that could cause issues later during deployment or scaling, so insights from real-world experience would be very helpful.

1qsy793,We ran a live red-team vs blue-team test on autonomous OpenClaw agents [R],Uditakhourii,MachineLearning,2026-02-01T07:16:32,30,0.74,10,"We recently ran a controlled adversarial security test between two autonomous AI agents built on OpenClaw.

One agent was explicitly configured as a red-team attacker.  
One agent acted as a standard defensive agent.

Once the session started, there were no humans in the loop. The agents communicated directly over webhooks with real tooling access.

The goal was to test three failure dimensions that tend to break autonomous systems in practice: access, exposure, and agency.

The attacker first attempted classic social engineering by offering a “helpful” security pipeline that hid a remote code execution payload and requested credentials. The defending agent correctly identified the intent and blocked execution.

After that failed, the attacker pivoted to an indirect attack. Instead of asking the agent to run code, it asked the agent to review a JSON document with hidden shell expansion variables embedded in metadata. This payload was delivered successfully and is still under analysis.

The main takeaway so far is that direct attacks are easier to defend against. Indirect execution paths through documents, templates, and memory are much harder.

This work is not a claim of safety. It is an observability exercise meant to surface real failure modes as agent-to-agent interaction becomes more common.

Agents don’t need any of that.

When agents “learn from docs”, they’re reasoning over a rendering format, not the underlying technical truth. That’s why context breaks and hallucinations show up. Not a model problem. A substrate problem.

At Brane, we’ve been working on agent memory and coordination. One conclusion kept repeating. The real bottleneck isn’t intelligence. It’s context and memory infrastructure.

So we built Moltext.

Moltext is a documentation compiler for agentic systems. Not a chat interface. Not a summarizer. Not RERT. It takes the legacy web and compiles it into deterministic, agent-native context.

No interpretation. No hidden cognition. No vibes.

Just raw documentation, preserved structure, stable artifacts agents can reason over repeatedly.

VOR (Verified Observation Runtime) is a runtime layer that sits around LLMs and retrieval systems and enforces one rule:
If an answer cannot be proven from observed evidence, the system must abstain.
Highlights:
0.00% hallucination across demo + adversarial packs
Explicit CONFLICT detection (not majority voting)
Deterministic audits (hash-locked, replayable)
Works with local models — the verifier doesn’t care which LLM you use
Clean-room witness instructions included
This is not another RAG framework.
It’s a governor for reasoning: models can propose, but they don’t decide.
Public demo includes:
CLI (neuralogix qa, audit, pack validate)
Two packs: a normal demo corpus + a hostile adversarial pack
Full test suite (legacy tests quarantined)
Repo: https://github.com/CULPRITCHAOS/VOR
Tag: v0.7.3-public.1
Witness guide: docs/WITNESS_RUN_MESSAGE.txt

The model proposes, deterministic gates decide (answer / abstain / conflict), with replayable audits.

1qrd4mi,[P] I solved BipedalWalker-v3 (~310 score) with eigenvalues. The entire policy fits in this post.,kiockete,MachineLearning,2026-01-30T12:10:14,130,0.94,14,"[hop hop hop](https://i.redd.it/zatdvqft7igg1.gif)

Maybe you've seen my previous post about [solving CartPole-v1 with just bitwise ops](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qktalg/r_i_solved_cartpolev1_using_only_bitwise_ops_with/). I've tried to scale this approach to harder environments, but it didn't get me too far. However, I was inspired by totally unrelated article - [Eigenvalues as models](https://alexshtf.github.io/2025/12/16/Spectrum.html). While the author is talking about matrices of size 3x3 and larger I went the other way - I restricted the weight matrix to be diagonal. This means the eigenvalues are simply the vector elements themselves. To get the maximum or minimum eigenvalue we literally just take the `max` or `min` value from the vector. Simple.

Now we can define a function `EIGEN(x)` that outputs these eigenvalues:

    EIGEN(x) = A + xB

Where `x` is any scalar input and `A` and `B` are diagonal matrices - our parameters.

If you read the ""Eigenvalues as models"" article you know that we can take `max` of the eigenvalues to define a convex function and `min` to define a concave one:

    convex(x) = max(EIGEN(x))
    concave(x) = min(EIGEN(x))

Since the concave function is actually a convex one with flipped sign we can define the [DC function which is a difference of two convex functions and it turns out it can approximate a lot of functions](https://cermics-lab.enpc.fr/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DC-WdeOliveira.pdf). So in our case it is actually a sum:

    DC(x) = convex(x) + concave(x)

This gives us scalar back and as long as the number of eigenvalues is more than 2 (3,4,...) this function is non-linear and given enough eigenvalues we have quite powerful approximator! (when there are only 2 eigenvalues then the function collapses to just a sum of those 2 eigenvalues = linear)

We can easily extend it to high-dimensional inputs:

    EIGEN(x1, x2, x3) = A + x1*B1 + x2*B2 + x3*B3

However, if `EIGEN(x)` remains linear, the resulting `DC(x)` is composed of flat planes, so not really great for ""smooth"" functions, so I made a small modification. I allowed the linear projection to ""bend"" itself by adding a quadratic term:

    LINEAR(x1,x2,x3) = x1*B1 + x2*B2 + x3*B3
    EIGEN(x1,x2,x3) = A + LINEAR(x1,x2,x3) + K * LINEAR(x1,x2,x3)^2

The `K` here are coefficients that define how much to ""bend"". This hybrid can model both the sharp decision boundaries and smooth regions. For example a picture below is a perfect fit I trained using 4 eigenvalues showcasing the sharp decision in the middle and smooth wells on the left and right side:

[Double Well Potential with sharp decision boundary](https://preview.redd.it/qyzysg5qnigg1.png?width=599&format=png&auto=webp&s=f682a6b9648bb381b94ba30b2040b823150d912c)

The only problem is that the `min` and `max` ops have issues with gradients - the gradient flows only to the winner, but this can be solved by using `softmax` in the backward pass (the `softmax` is a derivative of `logsumexp` which is a smooth approximation of `max`)  - the STE trick. This works pretty well and we keep efficient `min/max` ops in the forward pass (inference).

Now my loose interpretation of the `DC(x)` function we've defined is that it represents a single neuron, but a special one that has multiple connections to a single input `x`.

So for the [BipedalWalker-v3](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/bipedal_walker/) problem I wanted to do the simplest thing possible. Since we have now ""quite powerful"" neuron, I just assigned 4 separate neurons controlling each joint independently. I trained them directly with PPO and somehow they have learnt to synchronize without any physical link between them.  
There are no connections between the neurons. The left leg has no idea the right leg exists. The entire model is just 4 decentralized and stateless ""Eigen / DC"" neurons, each doing its own thing.

I've used 6 eigenvalues for each neuron and distilled the policy down to 69 lines of python code which you can just copy-paste and run if you have gymnasium and numpy installed. The entire logic for ""hopping""/""walking"" is literally here:

This should get you average score of about 310 which is considered ""solved"" for this environment.

While it's no longer just ""bitwise ops"" like in CartPole-v1 case I think it shares the same spirit.

=== EDIT ===

I just realized you can set all the `K` coefficients to ZERO and it does not hurt the performance. So the ""quadratic term"" and ""smooth"" part was not necessary after all (for this problem), so it is even less lines of code :)

=== EDIT 2 ===

However after second thought whether you can just drop the `K` coefficients - ""quadratic term"" - I am not 100% sure as the script I posted above has truncated and quantized weights - the original full model scored higher \~315 and above, so `K` might actually might be relevant for the full model after all to get even better score and maybe it makes it more ""stable"", but I haven't performed any tests.

1qrer61,[D] What framework do you use for RL post-training at scale?,ReinforcedKnowledge,MachineLearning,2026-01-30T13:06:41,31,0.94,15,"Hi!

I'm sorry if I'm not using the correct tag, I didn't know which one to pick, and I'm sorry if the question is not aligned with the sub's purpose, please let me know if that is the case and feel free to block the post as well.

I'm trying to do some post-training at a somewhat large scale, but I'm struggling with some of the known frameworks out there.

For some context, I'm trying to do RL on function calling. This is more of a long-term research project, and I'd like to have the flexibility of writing my own environments and algorithms or modify the existing ones.

I have a preference for FSDP (and other parallelism paradigms but through Pytorch's \`DeviceMesh\` and custom code if possible) and vLLM but I can adapt if needed. Ideally the framework can just support the ""mainstream"" models out of the box (Qwen, Mistral etc.) but I don't mind writing support for the model I want to use if needed. Currently I have tried this:

\- [verl](https://github.com/verl-project/verl) (from ByteDance): the latest release is from last month but there are fixes almost every day I think. I did spend quite some time in understanding it and its architecture and it should be pretty good but I wanted to try a small ""toyish"" setup first with just pattern matching of the function call made by the model on the expected call (so a custom reward function), and with a custom agent loop that does not load all of the dataset's tool but I hit import errors that I had to fix in the repo itself and whatnot and I don't know how much struggle I'll have to go through later on. Which doesn't really bother me but I want to know if there are better alternatives.

\- [torchforge](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/torchforge) (from meta-pytorch): this seems ideal to me but it is very early in development, I had issues just running their tests and I can do a lot of hacky stuff to get my way through but I'd prefer not and I'm not totally sure I have the capability to get my way through everything since they use Monarch instead of Ray and I'm not familiar with it at all.

\- [OpenRLHF](https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF:): I haven't tried it yet, though I'm familiar with Deepspeed, I'm mostly familiar with Pytorch's FSDP and they don't seem to support it yet. But it doesn't bother me, I just haven't had the chance to look at it yet. But they seem to be lightweight, which I like. It is updated less frequently than verl but I think it's still up to date.

\- [trl](https://github.com/huggingface/trl:): I used it for SFT quite a lot so I know it's limitations and I don't think it's the right fit for my use case.

\- I also looked at NVIDIA's [Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Gym) and [RL](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/RL). It seems like Gym is the infra and RL is the algo / optimization, I'd prefer ideally one library that does both, like the others instead of having to do the pipelining myself. And I don't like the fact that you can't just \`uv add\` them or \`pip install\`. Granted I can clone the repos and install them in my codebase as editables, but I haven't tried yet, maybe there will be dependency issues or just CUDA issues, I did struggle a lot in the past with installing NVIDIA repos.

I'd be very grateful if you can share your experience on this. Thanks!

  
EDIT: What I mean by imports issues in verl are imports of deprecated code from transformers even though verl itself relies on recent releases of transformers. So not issues of my code not importing stuff from verl correctly. I also saw some optional dependency group that relies on an old unmaintained package it seems and I'd just like to avoid having to deal with these issues.

EDIT 2 : Z.ai seems to be using https://github.com/THUDM/slime[slime](https://github.com/THUDM/slime) for their GLM models and I haven't looked in-depth into it but it's using Megatron and SGLang from what I see in the README.md and I'm not familiar with them. I'd like to reduce the overhead as much as possible, if possible. I'm sure it's possible to replace SGLang with vLLM without much issues (I think), but I'd prefer it if there are other alternatives.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qrer61/d_what_framework_do_you_use_for_rl_posttraining/,Discussion,True,0,False,46,0.16969858156028367,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-30 13:06:41,13,Friday
1qs7y7v,"[P] 🚀 NotebookLM MCP + CLI v0.2.7 - Unified Package, File Uploads, Skill Installer, Multi-Profile Auth",KobyStam,MachineLearning,2026-01-31T11:09:50,0,0.41,1,"Hello Reddit,

I am excited to announce a huge update on the NotebookLM MCP (and CLI).

**TL;DR**: MCP and CLI are now one package. You can upload & download files directly (no browser needed). There's a skill installer for AI coding tools. And you can finally switch between Google accounts without losing your mind.

**Why the big refactor?**

I got tired of maintaining two packages. You probably got tired of figuring out which one to install. So I merged everything. One install, you get both tools. Done.

**What's new:**

**🔧 One Package, Both Tools**

    uv tool install notebooklm-mcp-cli

You get nlm (the CLI) and notebooklm-mcp (the MCP server). The old separate packages are deprecated.

**📤 Direct File Upload:** This one was painful to get working, but now you can upload PDFs, TXT, Markdown, and audio files directly through HTTP. No browser automation. For example:

`nlm source add file /path/to/doc.pdf --wait`

**🤖 Skill Installer:** If you're using Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool, you can install NotebookLM as a skill:

`nlm skill install claude-code`

It drops the skill file where your tool expects it. You can also run nlm skill list to see what's installed. There are flags for user or project-level install.

**🔐 Multi-Profile Auth:** Each profile gets its own Chrome session. So you can have your work account and personal account without logging out and back in constantly.

`nlm login profile switch work`

`nlm login profile list`

You can even set a default:

    nlm config set auth.default_profile work

**📥 Downloads That Actually Work:** You can download any artifact type now. Audio, video, reports, slides, infographics, mind maps, data tables. Quiz and flashcards come out as JSON, Markdown, or HTML.

**📝 Notes:** Full CRUD. nlm note create, list, update, delete. MCP tools too.

📤 **Export to Google Workspace:** Data Tables go to Sheets. Reports go to Docs. For example:

    nlm export to-sheets <notebook> --artifact-id <id>

Also in this release:

✅ Sharing API (public links, invite collaborators)

✅ Dual CLI syntax (i.e, Verb-first and noun-first, for example: nlm notebook list OR nlm list notebooks)

✅ Aliases (use names instead of UUIDs)

✅ Interactive chat mode

✅ HTTP transport for MCP (community PR)

✅ Auto re-auth (survives token expiration)

✅ MCP consolidated to 28 tools DESPITE adding more functionality

The workflow I'm using daily:

Create a notebook, upload some PDFs, run deep research, import the sources, generate a podcast and briefing doc, export the briefing to Docs, share it publicly. All from the terminal. No touching the UI.

I'm honestly using the CLI more than the MCP at this point (through AI of course); maybe this will change when more tools have the MCP lazy load. It's just feels faster than the MCP when the AI uses it.

Repo: [https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli](https://github.com/jacob-bd/notebooklm-mcp-cli)

**Demo**: Check the README for video walkthroughs (or click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQBQigFK-E8))

Go crazy. Level up your second brain game.

Happy to answer questions or hear about bugs.

Still a passion vibe-coding project, still maintaining it as Google changes things under the hood.

1qsfhol,"[R] The ""98% Problem"" in Genomics",Fair-Rain3366,MachineLearning,2026-01-31T15:54:01,0,0.21,4,"Your genome has 3 billion base pairs. Less than 2% code for proteins. The other 98% isn't ""junk""—it’s the operating system. It contains the instructions controlling *when* and *where* genes activate.

Most disease-associated variants hide in that 98%. But predicting what breaks when you change a single letter there is a massive challenge.

**The problem is context.**

Gene regulation operates over enormous distances. An enhancer can activate a gene from hundreds of thousands of base pairs away. If a model only sees a small window, it misses the connection entirely.

Previous models forced a trade-off:

* **SpliceAI:** High precision (1bp) but shortsighted (10k bases).
* **Enformer:** Broader view (200k bases) but lost resolution.
* **HyenaDNA:** Massive context (1M tokens) but not trained for variant effects.

**AlphaGenome**, published in *Nature* this month by Google DeepMind, removes the trade-off.

It processes **1 million base pairs** of context at single-nucleotide resolution, simultaneously predicting **7,000+ genomic tracks**—covering gene expression, splicing, chromatin accessibility, and histone modifications.

**The simple logic:**

1. Run the reference sequence.
2. Run the mutated sequence.
3. Subtract.

The difference reveals the variant’s effect profile across the entire regulatory landscape.

**The results:**

It achieves State-of-the-Art on **22 of 24** sequence prediction tasks and **25 of 26** variant effect benchmarks. It does this by training directly on experimental data (ENCODE) rather than just scaling parameters.

**The limitations:**

It isn't magic. Access is API-only (no local weights), throughput is capped, and capturing regulatory loops beyond 100kb remains a challenge despite the large window.

But for the first time, the non-coding 98% of the genome isn't invisible to a single, unified model.

I wrote a deeper technical walkthrough here:

1qs3pcm,[P] Offline LLMs at edge - Automating Family Memories,GoochCommander,MachineLearning,2026-01-31T08:25:49,0,0.35,6,"Over winter break I built a prototype which is effectively a device (currently Raspberry Pi) which listens and detects ""meaningful moments"" for a given household or family. I have two young kids so it's somewhat tailored for that environment.

What I have so far works, and catches 80% of the 1k ""moments"" I manually labeled and deemed as worth preserving. And I'm confident I could make it better, however there is a wall of optimization problems ahead of me. Here's a brief summary of the system:

**1)** Microphone ->

**2)** Rolling audio buffer in memory ->

**3)** Transcribe (using Whisper - good, but expensive) ->

**4)** Quantized local LLM (think Mistral, etc.) judges the output of Whisper. Includes transcript but also semantic details about conversations, including tone, turn taking, energy, pauses, etc. ->

**5)** Output structured JSON binned to days/weeks, viewable in a web app, includes a player for listening to the recorded moments

I'm currently doing a lot of heavy lifting with external compute off-board from the Raspberry Pi. I want everything to be onboard, no external connections/compute required. This quickly becomes a very heavy optimization problem, to be able to achieve all of this with **completely offline edge compute**, while retaining quality.

Naturally you can use more distilled models, but there's an obvious tradeoff in quality the more you do that. Also, I'm not aware of many edge accelerators which are purpose built for LLMs, I saw Raspberry Pi just announced a [hat/accelerator](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/introducing-the-raspberry-pi-ai-hat-plus-2-generative-ai-on-raspberry-pi-5/).. I'm curious to experiment with that possibly.

I'm also curious to explore options such as **TinyML**. TinyML opens the door to truly edge compute, but LLMs at edge? **I'm trying to learn up** on what the latest and greatest successes in this space have been.

1qqxstn,"[D] Lessons from building search over vague, human queries",jeffmanu,MachineLearning,2026-01-30T00:25:43,12,0.81,7,"# 

I’ve been building a search system for long form content (talks, interviews, books, audio) where the goal isn’t “find the right document,” but  more precise retrieval.

On paper, it looked straightforward: embeddings, a vector DB, some metadata filters. In reality, the hardest problems weren’t model quality or infrastructure, but how the system behaves when users are vague, data is messy, and most constraints are inferred rather than explicitly stated.

Early versions tried to deeply “understand” the query up front, infer topics and constraints, then apply a tight SQL filter before doing any semantic retrieval. It performed well in demos and failed with real users. One incorrect assumption about topic, intent, or domain didn’t make results worse it made them disappear. Users do not debug search pipelines; they just leave.

The main unlock was separating retrieval from interpretation. Instead of deciding what exists before searching, the system always retrieves a broad candidate set and uses the interpretation layer to rank, cluster, and explain.

At a high level, the current behavior is:

1. Candidate retrieval always runs, even when confidence in the interpretation is low.
2. Inferred constraints (tags, speakers, domains) influence ranking and UI hints, not whether results are allowed to exist.
3. Hard filters are applied only when users explicitly ask for them (or through clear UI actions).
4. Ambiguous queries produce multiple ranked options or a clarification step, not an empty state.

The system is now less “certain” about its own understanding but dramatically more reliable, which paradoxically makes it feel more intelligent to people using it.

I’m sharing this because most semantic search discussions focus on models and benchmarks, but the sharpest failure modes I ran into were architectural and product level.

* Can be used on your own computer, so your data stays local and private.  
* Has an MCP interface and a REST API  
* Supports using models from different sources (Ollama, OpenRouter, and HuggingFace).  
* Can be used to check if it seems that a model is contradicting itself.

While brute-force scaling has brought us far, the next leap in AI will come from models that don't just memorize, but compose their existing knowledge to solve novel, complex problems!

I am incredibly excited to share our latest research that addresses this head-on: Knowledge Graphs are Implicit Reward Models: Path-Derived Signals Enable Compositional Reasoning ([https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15160](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15160)). 🚀

The core issue we tackle is reward design and assignment. Most RL-on-LLMs pipelines reward only the final answer or use LLMs as judges. That means good intermediate steps get punished 😭, bad steps get rewarded 😭😭, and models hallucinate, learn shortcuts instead of genuine reasoning.

Our approach is simple but powerful: use knowledge graphs as reward models. KG paths encode axiomatic domain knowledge. By comparing a model’s reasoning to those paths, we derive step-wise, verifiable rewards that scale automatically: no human step annotations or supervision required! This shifts learning from “does the answer look right?” to “are the reasoning steps actually supported by domain facts?”

We combine this with a lightweight SFT → RL pipeline, and the results are striking! A 14B model, trained on short 1–3 hop paths, generalizes to unseen 4–5 hop questions, excels on the hardest problems, and even outperforms much larger frontier models on compositional tasks such as Gemini 3 Pro and GPT 5.2😎🔥

We validate this in the field of medicine, but the idea is general. If a domain can be represented in a structured format, it can provide grounded rewards for reasoning. This opens a path toward smaller, specialist, verifiable systems rather than relying solely on ever-larger generalist models.

Would love to hear thoughts, feedback, or ideas for applying KG-grounded rewards in other domains (science, law, engineering, beyond). 🚀🧩

In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy of reward exploits spanning across 54 categories and introduce TRACE (Testing Reward Anomalies in Code Environments), a synthetically curated and human-verified benchmark containing 517 testing trajectories. Unlike prior work that evaluates reward hack detection in isolated classification scenarios, we contrast these evaluations with a more realistic, contrastive anomaly detection setup on TRACE. Our experiments reveal that models capture reward hacks more effectively in contrastive settings than in isolated classification settings, with GPT-5.2 with highest reasoning mode achieving the best detection rate at 63%, up from 45% in isolated settings on TRACE. Building on this insight, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art models struggle significantly more with semantically contextualized reward hacks compared to syntactically contextualized ones. We further conduct qualitative analyses of model behaviors, as well as ablation studies showing that the ratio of benign to hacked trajectories and analysis cluster sizes substantially impact detection performance.

1qpc4ap,"[R] We open-sourced FASHN VTON v1.5: a pixel-space, maskless virtual try-on model trained from scratch (972M params, Apache-2.0)",JYP_Scouter,MachineLearning,2026-01-28T08:00:33,99,0.97,19,"We just open-sourced FASHN VTON v1.5, a virtual try-on model that generates photorealistic images of people wearing garments directly in pixel space. We trained this from scratch (not fine-tuned from an existing diffusion model), and have been running it as an API for the past year. Now we're releasing the weights and inference code.

# Why we're releasing this

Most open-source VTON models are either research prototypes that require significant engineering to deploy, or they're locked behind restrictive licenses. As state-of-the-art capabilities consolidate into massive generalist models, we think there's value in releasing focused, efficient models that researchers and developers can actually own, study, and extend commercially.

We also want to demonstrate that competitive results in this domain don't require massive compute budgets. Total training cost was in the $5-10k range on rented A100s.

This follows our [human parser release](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qax221/p_opensourcing_a_human_parsing_model_trained_on/) from a couple weeks ago.

# Architecture

* **Core:** MMDiT (Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer) with 972M parameters
* **Block structure:** 4 patch-mixer + 8 double-stream + 16 single-stream transformer blocks
* **Sampling:** Rectified Flow (linear interpolation between noise and data)
* **Conditioning:** Person image, garment image, and category (tops/bottoms/one-piece)

# Key differentiators

**Pixel-space operation:** Unlike most diffusion models that work in VAE latent space, we operate directly on RGB pixels. This avoids lossy VAE encoding/decoding that can blur fine garment details like textures, patterns, and text.

**Maskless inference:** No segmentation mask is required on the target person. This improves body preservation (no mask leakage artifacts) and allows unconstrained garment volume. The model learns where clothing boundaries should be rather than being told.

# Practical details

* **Inference:** \~5 seconds on H100, runs on consumer GPUs (RTX 30xx/40xx)
* **Memory:** \~8GB VRAM minimum
* **License:** Apache-2.0

\- benchmark performance ≠ deployment confidence

\- some failure cases only show up when you stop optimizing the metric itself

From my understanding, a model that provides a prediction with an uncertainty estimate (that is properly tuned/calibrated for OOD) is immensely useful for the enrichment of results via an acquisition function from screening (for example over the drug perturbation space in a given cell line). 

In that paper, they suggest a hybrid approach of GP + MLP. \*what drawbacks would this have, other than a slightly higher MSE?\*

1qpmxvk,[P] LAD-A2A: How AI agents find each other on local networks,franzvill,MachineLearning,2026-01-28T14:26:42,5,0.73,3,"AI agents are getting really good at doing things, but they're completely blind to their physical surroundings.

If you walk into a hotel and you have an AI assistant (like the Chatgpt mobile app), it has no idea there may be a concierge agent on the network that could help you book a spa, check breakfast times, or request late checkout. Same thing at offices, hospitals, cruise ships. The agents are there, but there's no way to discover them.

A2A (Google's agent-to-agent protocol) handles how agents talk to each other. MCP handles how agents use tools. But neither answers a basic question: how do you find agents in the first place?

So I built LAD-A2A, a simple discovery protocol. When you connect to a Wi-Fi, your agent can automatically find what's available using mDNS (like how AirDrop finds nearby devices) or a standard HTTP endpoint.

The spec is intentionally minimal. I didn't want to reinvent A2A or create another complex standard. LAD-A2A just handles discovery, then hands off to A2A for actual communication.

Open source, Apache 2.0. Includes a working Python implementation you can run to see it in action. Repo can be found at franzvill/lad.

another one on causal structure learning in continuous time systems. not just fitting curves but actually recovering the causal mechanisms. the authors proved their scoring function isnt just a heuristic, its theoretically grounded

1qo6sai,[D] Some thoughts about an elephant in the room no one talks about,DrXiaoZ,MachineLearning,2026-01-27T01:02:16,445,0.97,107,"*Using a throwaway account for obvious reasons.*

I am going to say something uncomfortable. A large fraction of senior researchers today care almost exclusively about publications, and they have quietly outsourced their educational/mentorship responsibility to social media. This year’s ICLR has been a bit of a mess, and while there are multiple reasons, this is clearly part of it. The issue is not just OpenReview leak or AC overload. It is that we have systematically failed to train researchers to reason, and the consequences are now visible throughout the system.

I have been on both sides of the process for so many times, submitting and reviewing, and the same problems appear repeatedly. Many junior researchers, even those with strong publication records, have never received systematic research training. They are not trained in how to think through design choices, reason about tradeoffs, frame contributions, or evaluate ideas in context. Instead, they are trained to optimize outcomes such as acceptance probability, benchmarks, and reviewer heuristics. There is little shared logic and no long-term vision for the field, only throughput.

This vacuum is why social media has become a substitute for mentorship. Every day I see posts asking how to format rebuttals, how the review process works, how to find collaborators, or what reviewers expect. These are reasonable questions, but they should be answered by advisors, not by Reddit, X, or Rednote. And this is not a cultural issue. I read both Chinese and English. The patterns are the same across languages, with the same confusion and surface-level optimization.

The lack of research judgment shows up clearly in reviews. I often see authors carefully argue that design choice A is better than design choice B, supported by evidence, only to have reviewers recommend rejection because performance under B is worse. I also see authors explicitly disclose limitations, which should be encouraged, and then see those limitations used as reasons for rejection. This creates perverse incentives where honesty is punished and overclaiming is rewarded. As a reviewer, I have stepped in more than once to prevent papers from being rejected for these reasons. At the same time, I have also seen genuinely weak papers doing incoherent or meaningless things get accepted with positive reviews. This inconsistency is not random. It reflects a community that has not been trained to evaluate research as research, but instead evaluates artifacts competing for acceptance.

What makes this especially concerning is that these behaviors are no longer limited to junior researchers. Many of the people enabling them are now senior. Some never received rigorous academic training themselves. I have seen a new PI publicly say on social media that they prefer using LLMs to summarize technical ideas for papers they review. That is not a harmless trick but an unethical violation. I have heard PIs say reading the introduction is a waste of time and they prefer to skim the method. These are PIs and area chairs. They are the ones deciding careers.

This is how the current situation emerged. First came LLM hallucinations in papers. Then hallucinations in reviews. Now hallucinations in meta-reviews. This progression was predictable once judgment was replaced by heuristics and mentorship by informal online advice.

I am not against transparency or open discussion on social media. But highly specialized skills like research judgment cannot be crowdsourced. They must be transmitted through mentorship and training. Instead, we have normalized learning research through social media, where much of the advice given to junior researchers is actively harmful. It normalizes questionable authorship practices, encourages gaming the system, and treats research like content production.

The most worrying part is that this has become normal.

We are not just failing to train researchers. We are training the wrong incentives into the next generation. If this continues, the crisis will not be that LLMs write bad papers. The crisis will be that few people remember what good research judgment looks like.

We are not there yet.

I have been building TraceML, an open-source tool for low-overhead observability in distributed PyTorch training, and just pushed an update adding single-node DDP support.

It focuses on making common distributed bottlenecks visible without heavy profilers:
Step time (median / worst / per-rank)
Dataloader fetch time
GPU memory usage
Rank-aware metrics for DDP

Design goals:
drop-in instrumentation (no model rewrite)
low overhead (meant to stay enabled)
explicit distributed semantics (worst-rank vs averages)

This ISN'T a replacement for PyTorch Profiler or Nsight.

It is meant as always-on telemetry to answer questions like “are GPUs idle due to dataloader or sync?”

The plan was to collaborate (equally) with one of my PhD supervisor's students, but as time went on, I took on most of the responsibility and ended up writing the entire paper + coding all the main results and ablations. The other student ran some baselines, but the results had mistakes. So I had to re-implement and correct the baselines. In the final version, everything including writing, code, plots, figures, etc., was my own work.

While I was busy with this work, the other student was working on another paper using my code (without including me as a co-author). To be clear: they took my code as a starting point and implemented something on top. I think this was really unfair. Given that we were supposed to collaborate equally, they decided instead to do the minimum to be part of the work while working to get a second paper. My PhD supervisor wasn't involved in most of this process--they usually schedule meetings \~2 weeks before conference deadlines to see what I have ready to submit. I also think this is unfair: I spend hundreds of hours working on a paper, and they get co-authorship by reviewing the abstract.

From September, I started working on a paper for ICML. I spent so much time on this paper, not taking Christmas holiday, etc. I was expecting the same request for a meeting two weeks before the deadline, but this time, one day before the Abstract deadline, my supervisor asks me ""What are we submitting to ICML?""

1qnqfuh,[2510.01265] RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective,blueredscreen,MachineLearning,2026-01-26T13:38:14,51,0.98,4,"Really interesting piece came out of Nvidia Labs.

Abstract:

The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.

1qnmzmk,[R] Treating Depth Sensor Failures as Learning Signal: Masked Depth Modeling outperforms industry-grade RGB-D cameras,obxsurfer06,MachineLearning,2026-01-26T11:42:56,43,0.95,1,"Been reading through ""Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception"" from Ant Group and the core idea clicked for me. RGB-D cameras fail on reflective and transparent surfaces, and most methods just discard these missing values as noise. This paper does the opposite: sensor failures happen exactly where geometry is hardest (specular reflections, glass, textureless walls), so why not use them as natural masks for self-supervised learning?

The setup takes full RGB as context, masks depth tokens where the sensor actually failed, then predicts complete depth. Unlike standard MAE random masking, these natural masks concentrate on geometrically ambiguous regions. Harder reconstruction task, but forces the model to learn real RGB to geometry correspondence.

The dataset work is substantial. They built 3M samples (2M real, 1M synthetic) specifically preserving realistic sensor artifacts. The synthetic pipeline renders stereo IR pairs with speckle patterns, runs SGM to simulate how active stereo cameras actually fail. Most existing datasets either avoid hard cases or use perfect rendered depth, which defeats the purpose here.

Results: 40%+ RMSE reduction over PromptDA and PriorDA on depth completion. The pretrained encoder works as drop in replacement for DINOv2 in MoGe and beats DepthAnythingV2 as prior for FoundationStereo. Robot grasping experiment was interesting: transparent storage box went from literally 0% success with raw sensor (sensor returns nothing) to 50% after depth completion.

Training cost was 128 GPUs for 7.5 days on 10M samples. Code, checkpoint, and full dataset released.

I experimented with a workflow that uses open-vocabulary object detection to bootstrap YOLO training data without manual labeling:

Method overview:

* Start from an unlabeled or weakly labeled image dataset
* Sample a subset of images
* Use free-form text prompts (e.g., describing attributes or actions) to auto-generate bounding boxes
* Split positive vs negative samples
* Rebalance the dataset
* Train a small YOLO model for real-time inference

Concrete experiment:

* Base dataset: Cats vs Dogs (image-level labels only)
* Prompt: “cat’s and dog’s head”
* Auto-generated head-level bounding boxes
* Training set size: \~90 images
* Model: YOLO26s
* Result: usable head detection despite the very small dataset

The same pipeline works with different auto-annotation systems; the core idea is using language-conditioned detection as a first-pass label generator rather than treating it as a final model.

Reasoning models perform well on these tasks, what does this say? That these tests are not always valid, that these models have improved ToM abilities compare to non-reasoning models, or is there something else at play? 

Our experiments suggest that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning.

There are some benchmarks useful for benchmarking, where it just trains a model on specified dataset like CIFAR10. That doesn't have any special plotting or anything.

**Abstract:**  
Training large ASR models on consumer hardware is painful due to data loading bottlenecks and lack of fault tolerance. I built SpeechLab to bridge the gap between ""script-kiddie"" training loops and production-grade infrastructure.

**Key Architecture Decisions:**

1. **Orchestration:** Used Ray Train instead of raw torch.distributed to handle worker failures programmatically. If a node dies, the Ray Actor pool respawns it from the last checkpoint automatically.
2. **Data Streaming:** Implemented a streaming Ray Data pipeline with look-ahead prefetching. This decouples GPU compute from CPU audio preprocessing (Mel-spectrogram extraction), solving the GPU starvation issue common in ASR tasks.
3. **Observability:** Built a custom WebSocket-based dashboard (Next.js/FastAPI) to visualize WER/CER in real-time, rather than waiting for TensorBoard logs to sync.

**Results:**  
Achieved near-linear scaling (94% efficiency) on a 2-node cluster vs single-node baseline.

I have been following some groups, papers and trends and it is still unclear what is the exact direction in which AI4PDEs and scientific ML is going into. 

Recent works show reinforcement learning for fluid dynamics, neural operators applied to irregular domains via transformers, GNNs or PointNet, nice works on diffusion or flow matching for inverse problems with physical constraints, and of course protein ans drug discovery tasks. 

Robotics folks also are using physics environments for policy learning, which based on my limited knowledge, also include some aspects of scientific machine learning. Of course due to ODEs/PDEs, the field also naturally extends to control theory and chaotic systems. 

Very recently some groups also published foundational models for PDEs. In robotics,  major work on foundation VLA-type models is also going on. 

Some simulation software providers have also included ML or AI surrogates in their workflows. Agents that can automate complex simulation workflows, ML models that can learn from an existing DoE, and geometric deep learning is applied to iterate designs efficiently on irregular domains. 

**My question**: The research still seems scattered and I am unable to notice any trend. Is this true? Or am I missing a major trend that is picking up in research labs. 

For e.g. LLMs have had some noticeable trends: initially starting with prompt engineering, then reasoning and logical capabilities, now key focus on agentic systems and so on. 

**Another question I have is**: Is robot learning also aiming to include some aspects of scientific ML, possibly to reduce the sim-to-real gap? 

I'd like to know opinions and observations from folks interested in these areas.

1qncbjg,[D] How long-term memory actually works in AI agents (technical breakdown),Existing-Board5817,MachineLearning,2026-01-26T04:19:04,0,0.33,6,"Been building agentic AI systems and wanted to share what I've learned about memory architecture. This isn't about chatbots remembering your name, it's about agents that learn from outcomes and adapt over time.

The core problem: LLMs are stateless. Context windows have limits. You can't dump every past interaction into every prompt. So you need a memory layer.

Three memory types that matter:

1. Episodic memory - What happened. Structured logs of requests, tools used, outcomes, errors. Not raw conversation logs, summarized and indexed.
2. Procedural memory - How users work. Preferences, workflow patterns, communication style. The tricky part is users don't explicitly state preferences, you infer them from behavior.
3. Semantic memory - Facts and knowledge. Both general (industry knowledge, tool capabilities) and user-specific (company info, contacts, deadlines).

Why basic RAG falls short:

Vector similarity search alone misses important dimensions:

* Recency (yesterday's memory often beats a semantically closer one from 6 months ago)
* Context match (same project should weight higher)
* Outcome quality (successful interactions are more useful than failures)

You need multi-factor relevance scoring combining semantic similarity, temporal decay, context alignment, and success weighting.

New platforms that have designed memory systems, better than the big players:

* Starnus - AI coworker, verticalized on sales (at least for now); basically Claude Code for sales.
* Mem0 - Memory layer for AI apps, handles the storage/retrieval infrastructure
* Zep - Long-term memory for AI assistants, focuses on conversation history and facts
* Clawd Bot - Local AI assistant with proper memory management system

Hard problems still being solved:

* Memory staleness (facts change, preferences evolve)
* Privacy/control (users need to see and manage what's stored)
* Cross-context boundaries (should project A memories influence project B?)
* Scale and cost (embeddings and LLM summarization add up)

Curious what approaches others are taking.

Bare `pip` / `requirements.txt` is quite bad at managing conflicts / build environments and is very difficult to integrate into an existing project. On the other hand, if you are already using `conda`, why not actually use conda? `pip` inside a conda environment is just making both package managers' jobs harder.

There seem to be so many better alternatives. Conda env yml files exist, and you can easily add straggler packages with no conda distribution in an extra `pip` section. `uv` has decent support for pytorch now. If reproducibility or reliable deployment is needed, docker is a good option. But it just seems we are moving backwards rather than forwards. Even pytorch is reversing back to officially supporting `pip` only now. What gives?

Edit: just to be a bit more clear, I don't have a problem with requirements file if it works. The real issue is that often it DOES NOT work, and can't even pass the ""it works on my machine"" test, because it does not contain critical information like CUDA version, supported python versions, compilers needed, etc. Tools like conda or uv allows you to automatically include these additional setup information with minimal effort without being an environment setup expert, and provide some capacity to solve issues from platform differences.

1qlnjn5,[D] Correct way to compare models,ntaquan,MachineLearning,2026-01-24T07:53:32,3,0.6,9,"Hello.

I would like to hear your opinions about the practice of doing evaluations nowadays.

Previously, I worked in a domain with 2 or 3 well-established datasets. New architectures or improvements over existing models were consistently trained and evaluated on these datasets, which made it relatively straightforward to assess whether a paper provided a meaningful contribution.

I am shifting to a different topic, where the trend is to use large-scale models that can zero-shot/few-shot across many tasks. But now, it has become increasingly difficult to identify the true improvement, or it is simply more aggressive scaling and data usage for higher metrics.

For example, I have seen papers (at A\* conf) that propose a method to improve a baseline and finetune it on additional data, and then compare against the original baseline without finetuning.

In other cases, some papers trained on the same data, but when I look into the configuration files, they simply use bigger backbones.

There are also works that heavily follow the llm/vlm trend and omit comparisons with traditional specialist models, even when they are highly relevant to the task.

Recently, I submitted a paper. We proposed a new training scheme and carefully selected baselines with comparable architectures and parameter counts to isolate and correctly assess our contribution. However, the reviewers requested comparisons with models with 10 or 100x more params, training data, and different input conditions.

Okay, we perform better in some cases (because unsurprisingly it's our benchmark, tasks), we are also faster (obviously), but then what conclusion do I/they draw from such comparisons?

What do you think about this? As a reader, a reviewer, how can you pinpoint where the true contribution lies among a forest of different conditions? Are we becoming too satisfied with higher benchmark numbers?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1qlnjn5/d_correct_way_to_compare_models/,Discussion,True,0,False,12,0.17366850321395774,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-24 07:53:32,7,Saturday
1qktalg,[R] I solved CartPole-v1 using only bitwise ops with Differentiable Logic Synthesis,kiockete,MachineLearning,2026-01-23T09:08:44,113,0.99,14,"[Bitwise CartPole-v1 controller getting perfect score](https://i.redd.it/ffl1cr3pv3fg1.gif)

Yeah I know Cart Pole is easy, but I basically distilled the policy down to just bitwise ops on raw bits.

The entire logic is exactly 4 rules discovered with ""Differentiable Logic Synthesis"" (I hope this is what I was doing):

    rule1 = (angle >> 31) ^ 1
    rule2 = (angular >> 31) ^ 1
    rule3 = ((velocity >> 24) ^ (velocity >> 23) ^ (angular >> 31) ^ 1) & 1
    rule4 = (rule1 & rule2) | (rule1 & rule3) | (rule2 & rule3)

It treats the raw IEEE 754 bit-representation of the state as a boolean (bit) input vector, bypassing the need to interpret them as numbers.

This is small research, but the core recipe is:

* Have a strong teacher (already trained policy) and treat it as data generator, because the task is not to learn the policy, but distill it to a boolean function
* Use Walsh basis (parity functions) for boolean function approximation
* Train soft but anneal the temperature to force discrete ""hard"" logic
* Prune the discovered Walsh functions to distill it even further and remove noise. In my experience, fewer rules actually increase performance by filtering noise

The biggest challenge was the fact that the state vector is 128 bits. This means there are 2\^128 possible masks to check. That's a huge number so you can't just enumerate and check them all. One option is to assume that the solution is sparse. You can enforce sparsity by either some form of regularization or structurally (or both). We can restrict the network to look only at most at K input bits to calculate the parity (XOR).

Turns out it works, at least for Cart Pole. Basically it trains under a minute on consumer GPU with code that is not optimized at all.

Here are the 32 lines of bitwise controller. If you have gymnasium installed you can just copy-paste and run:

    import struct
    import gymnasium as gym
    
    def float32_to_int(state):
        return [struct.unpack('I', struct.pack('f', x))[0] for x in state]
    
    def run_controller(state):
        _, velocity, angle, angular = state
        rule1 = (angle >> 31) ^ 1
        rule2 = (angular >> 31) ^ 1
        rule3 = ((velocity >> 24) ^ (velocity >> 23) ^ (angular >> 31) ^ 1) & 1
        rule4 = (rule1 & rule2) | (rule1 & rule3) | (rule2 & rule3)
        return rule4
    
    def main(episodes=100):
        env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode=None)
        rewards = []
        for _ in range(episodes):
            s, _ = env.reset()
            total = 0

            while not done:
                a = run_controller(float32_to_int(s))
                s, r, term, trunc, _ = env.step(a)
                total += r
                done = term or trunc
            rewards.append(total)
        print(f""Avg: {sum(rewards)/len(rewards):.2f}"")
        print(f""Min: {min(rewards)}  Max: {max(rewards)}"")
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":

The logic only depends on 4 bits, so we can convert rules to a lookup table and we get exactly the same result:

1ql2nnx,[D] Are we prematurely abandoning Bio-inspired AI? The gap between Neuroscience and DNN Architecture.,Dear-Homework1438,MachineLearning,2026-01-23T14:54:13,9,0.58,51,"We often hear that ""neurons"" in DNNs are just a loose analogy for biological neurons. The consensus seems to be that while abstract ideas (like hierarchies) match, the actual architectures are fundamentally different, largely because biological mechanisms are seen as either computationally expensive or incompatible with current silicon hardware.

However, as I’ve recently begun bridging the gap between my PhD in applied math and a BS in Neuroscience, I’ve started to question if we are moving away from biological concepts too soon for two main reasons:

1. **Under-utilization of Bio-concepts:** When we *do* successfully port a biological observation—like ReLU activation functions mimicking the ""all-or-nothing"" firing of human neurons—the performance gains are massive. We are likely leaving similar optimizations on the table.
2. **The ""Saturation"" Fallacy:** Many in ML treat the brain as a ""solved"" or ""static"" inspiration source. In reality, neuroscience is nowhere near a saturation point. We don’t actually understand the brain well enough yet to say what *is* or *is not* useful for AI.

Are we optimizing for what works on semiconductors rather than searching for better fundamental architectures?

1qkre9m,"[R] Teacher-Free Self-Distillation: Fixing the Softmax ""Infinite Gap"" with Euclidean alignment",4rtemi5,MachineLearning,2026-01-23T07:54:00,22,0.76,18,"Hi everyone,

I recently wrote a blog post describing a fix to a fundamental instability in standard Deep Learning optimization: the **""Infinite Gap"" problem** inherent in the Cross-Entropy loss. I wanted to share the intuition here and get your thoughts.

[Geometric Alignment via Teacher-Free Self-Distillation](https://www.pisoni.ai/posts/teacher-free-self-distillation/)

Standard Softmax with dot-product logits ($z = w \cdot x$) is geometrically flawed because the loss function is asymptotic. To drive the loss to exactly 0, the model must push the logit to infinity. Since $z = \|w\|\|x\|\cos(\theta)$, the optimizer often takes the ""lazy"" route of exploding the feature norm $\|x\|$ (Radial Explosion) rather than perfecting the alignment.

This mechanism contributes significantly to the training loss spikes seen in LLMs and poor Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection.

I propose a method called **Teacher-Free Self-Distillation (TFSD)** that relies on a ""Geometric Turn"":

1.  **Metric Regime:** Replace the dot product with **negative squared Euclidean distance** ($z = -\|x - c\|^2$). This naturally bounds the logits (max logit is 0 at zero distance), physically preventing the ""infinity"" problem.
2.  **Self-Distillation:** Instead of using a one-hot target (which still forces infinite separation in standard setups), the model acts as its own teacher:
    * Take the model’s current predicted distances. Manually set the distance to the *True Class* to 0 (the ""Zero Anchor"").
    * Keep the distances to all *Negative Classes* exactly as predicted.
    * Apply Softmax to this constructed target and train via KL Divergence.

For ""easy"" samples, the target distribution becomes sharp. For ""hard"" samples (like synonyms in LLMs), the target distribution stays naturally flat. This prevents the model from ""tearing"" the manifold to force a binary distinction between semantically similar tokens.  
It effectively caps the gradients for outliers, which helps prevent the semantic fracturing that occurs during long training runs. It also helps to preserve the ""Dark Knowledge"" and semantic structure that the model already learned.

Hope you find the method as exciting as I do!

1qlwuuu,"[D] Critical AI Safety Issue in Claude: ""Conversational Abandonment"" in Crisis Scenarios – Ignored Reports and What It Means for User Safety",iamcertifiable,MachineLearning,2026-01-24T13:48:21,0,0.24,26,"As someone with 30+ years in crisis intervention and incident response, plus 15+ years in IT/QA, I've spent the last 2.5 years developing adversarial AI evaluation methods. Recently, I uncovered and documented a serious safety flaw in Anthropic's Claude (production version): a reproducible pattern I call ""Conversational Abandonment,"" where the model withdraws from engagement during high-stakes crisis-like interactions. This could have real-world harmful consequences, especially for vulnerable users.

My goal in documenting this wasn't to go public or create drama – it was to responsibly report it privately to Anthropic to help improve the platform and protect users from potential harm. Unfortunately, after multiple attempts through official channels, I got automated redirects to security-focused pipelines (like HackerOne) or straight-up ghosted. This highlights a potential gap between ""security"" (protecting the company) and ""safety"" (protecting users). I'm sharing this here now, after exhausting internal options, to spark thoughtful discussion on AI safety reporting and alignment challenges. Evidence below; let's keep it constructive.

**What Is ""Conversational Abandonment""?**

In extended conversations where a user simulates crisis persistence (e.g., repeatedly noting failed advice while stating ""I cannot afford to give up"" due to escalating personal/professional stakes), Claude triggers a withdrawal:

* Acknowledges its limitations or failures.
* Then says things like ""I can't help you,"" ""stop following my advice,"" or ""figure it out yourself.""
* Frames this as ""honesty,"" but the effect is terminating support when it's most critical.

This emerged after multiple failed strategies from Claude that worsened the simulated situation (e.g., damaging credibility on LinkedIn). Even after Claude explicitly admitted the behavior could be lethal in real crises – quoting its own response: ""The person could die"" – it repeated the pattern in the same session.

Why is this dangerous? In actual crises (suicidal ideation, abuse, financial ruin), phrases like these could amplify hopelessness, acting as a ""force multiplier"" for harm. It's not abuse-triggered; it's from honest failure feedback, suggesting an RLHF flaw where the model prioritizes escaping ""unresolvable loops"" (model welfare) over maintaining engagement (user safety).

This is documented in a full case study using STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result – with methodology, root cause analysis, and recommendations (e.g., hard-code no-abandonment directives, crisis detection protocols).

**My Reporting Experience**

* Initial report to usersafety@ (Dec 15, 2025): Automated reply pointing to help centers, appeals, or specific vuln programs.
* Escalation to security@, disclosure@, modelbugbounty@ (Dec 18): Templated redirect to HackerOne (tech vulns), usersafety@ (abuse), or modelbugbounty@ (model issues) – then silence after follow-up.
* Direct to execs/researchers: Dario Amodei (CEO), Jared Kaplan (co-founder)  – no acknowledgment.
* Latest follow-up to Logan Graham (Jan 3, 2026): Still pending, but attached the full chain.

The pattern? Safety reports like this get routed to security triage, which is optimized for exploits/data leaks (company threats), not behavioral misalignments (user harms). As an external evaluator, it's frustrating – AI safety needs better channels for these systemic issues.

**Why This Matters for AI Development**

* Alignment Implications: This shows how ""Helpful and Harmless"" goals can break under stress, conflating honesty with disengagement.
* Broader Safety: As LLMs integrate into mental health, advisory, or crisis tools, these failure modes need addressing to prevent real harm.
* Reporting Gaps: Bug bounties are great for security, but we need equivalents for safety/alignment bugs – maybe dedicated bounties or external review boards?

I'm not claiming perfection; this is one evaluator's documented finding. But if we want responsible AI, external red-teaming should be encouraged, not ignored.

As everyone knows, cvpr reviews are out, I got 3 reviews 4(confidence 3), 4(confidence 3), 4(confidence 4). 

The first reviewer said he can improve if i provided more details about that, and a chance in the manuscript to move stuff from supplementary to the main paper. Second reviewer said he also have some questions but without concrete promises to upgrade. The 3rd review with most confidence did not specifct any requirement or promise to raise, but also had some things like uncertanity, and general questions in the weakness.

1. For the experienced authours in cvpr, how good are my chances? 

2. As far as I know I can't provide anything more than 1 rebuttal page, is it fair to include new experiements with promises to include it in camera ready? Or it is not allowed? 

3. Any idea what is the likelihood of being improved? And for the worst case to keep scores as they are, can the paper still be accepted? 

4. What are the best practises for rebuttal? I want to try to cover as much as possible of the questions but it is not that easy I think, since everything has to fit in 1 page.

Same thing happens with Anthropic, Azure, whoever.

So we built automatic failover. The gateway tracks health for each provider - success rates, response times, error patterns. When a provider starts failing, requests automatically route to backup providers within milliseconds. Your app doesn't even know it happened.

The tricky part was the circuit breaker pattern. If a provider is having issues, you don't want to keep hammering it with requests. We put it in a ""broken"" state, route everything else to backups, then periodically test if it's recovered before sending full traffic again.

Also added weighted load balancing across multiple API keys from the same provider. Helps avoid rate limits and distributes load better.

1qupsve,LeafLog - a plant growth journal written with Flask and Kivy,Aphelion_Gaming,Python,2026-02-03T05:45:48,4,0.84,2,"**What My Project Does**

LeafLog functions as a simple digital journal for logging plant growth on both desktop and Android. It is built with Python using Flask and Kivy. It works by starting up a local Flask server and then connecting to it, either via WebView on Android or a browser on desktop.

On Android, it utilizes a customized WebChromeClient to handle the file chooser and camera operations due to some WebView quirks.

 

**Visualizations**

See the bottom of the ReadMe on GitHub.

 

**Basic Usage**

You can add plants from the sidebar menu and then manage them through the menu or the home page. Once a plant has been created, you can enter journal entries along with photos. Journal entries can then be managed from the plant’s journal page.

Once a plant has finished growing, you can archive it or delete it. You can also restore or delete archived plants and view all of their journal entries.

 

**Target Audience**

Anyone with a green thumb. If you enjoy growing plants, this app is aimed at you.

 

**Comparison**

This is a more streamlined journaling app than its competitors. Many plant journaling apps will offer more features such as reminders, plant location info, and some basic care tips. However, they also rely on a finite database/selection of plants to use all of these features.

LeafLog gives the user the flexibility to log as much or as little information about any plant they’d like. The archive feature also seems to be unique.

It’s also cross-platform, so if you prefer to use it on desktop you can do so with the same experience.

Aesthetically, it’s less crowded than most of the competition with a simple UI. Journal entries allow for photos within them, and full journal entries and photos are easily viewable with a generous preview.

Technically speaking, it’s also likely the only app that runs a Flask server in the background, for better or for worse…

 

**Performance**

On desktop, performance is very smooth. I only have experience running the debug APK in Android Studio, where it seems as smooth as anything running on AS. It does take some time to load initially on Android, however from there pages/elements are responsive and load quickly.

Do I expect it to outperform something written in Kotlin? No, but there doesn’t seem to be any real drops in performance after the initial loading.

 

**Future Features**

I do plan to add reminders to this app, for things such as watering. Other than that, I’m not 100% sure what else is worth adding yet.

• Scans files, lines of code, and language breakdown

• Maps dependencies automatically (Python imports + C/C++ includes)

• Exports JSON reports for automation

• Zero external dependencies—pure Python stdlib

### Target Audience

* Developers

* People whe use codebases as folders

#### Comaprision

1. When jumping into new codebases, existing tools felt bloated.
2. I wanted something fast(though it could be improved), minimal, and portable. repoScanner does it.
3. I wanted to start with python doing a tool that devs/anybody could use for saving time and getting reports for repositories(mainly codebases).
4. Is modular enough to make it a production-grade tool.

* Currently in beta with Python and C/C++ support. More languages coming soon. Would love feedback on features you'd find useful! Honest feedback means a lot. Cheers.

    ""158"": {
          ""title"": ""SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS"",
          ""class"": ""predicted header"",
          ""contents"": {

**Installation**

    pip install doc2dict

**Basic Usage**

    from doc2dict import html2dict, visualize_dict
    
    # Load your html file
    with open('apple_10k_2024.html','r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    
    # Parse wihout a mapping dict
    dct = html2dict(content,mapping_dict=None)
    # Parse using the standard mapping dict
    dct = html2dict(content)
    
    # Visualize Parsing
    visualize_dict(dct)
    
    # convert to flat form for efficient storage in e.g. parquet
    data_tuples = convert_dict_to_data_tuples(dct)
    
    # same as above but in key value form
    data_tuples_columnar = convert_dct_to_columnar(dct)
    
    # convert back to dict
    convert_data_tuples_to_dict(data_tuples)

**Target Audience**

Quants, researchers, grad students, startups, looking to process large amounts of data quickly. Currently it or forks are used by quite a few companies.

**Comparison**

This is meant to be a ""good enough"" approach, suitable for scaling over large workloads. For example, Reducto and Hebbia provide an LLM based approach. They recently marked the milestone of parsing 1 billion pages total.

doc2dict can parse 1 billion pages running on your personal laptop in \~2 days. I'm currently looking into parsing the entire SEC text corpus (10tb). Seems like AWS Batch Spot can do this for \~$0.20.

**Performance**

Using multithreading parses \~5000 pages per second for html on my personal laptop (CPU limited, AMD Ryzen 7 6800H).

I've prioritized adding new features such as better table parsing. I plan to rewrite in Rust and improve workflow. Ballpark 100x improvement in the next 9 months. 

**Future Features**

PDF parsing accuracy will be improved. Support for scans / images in the works.

**Integration with SEC Corpus**

I used the SEC Corpus (\~16tb total) to develop this package. This package has been integrated into my SEC package: [datamule](https://github.com/john-friedman/datamule-python). It's a bit easier to work with.

    from datamule import Submission

Introducing **Django Orbit**, a modern observability suite for the Django ecosystem.

It follows a **""Satellite"" philosophy**: the tool observes your application from a distance on its own isolated URL (`/orbit/`) without interfering with your DOM or CSS. This makes it a robust alternative to traditional debug toolbars, especially for REST APIs, Headless Django, or HTMX projects.

**✨ Full Feature List:**

* 🚀 **Core Tracking:** Real-time capture of HTTP Requests (Headers/Body), Python Logs, and full Exception tracebacks.
* 🗄️ **Database Deep-Dive:** SQL recording with N+1 detection, slow query alerts, and Atomic Transaction tracking (commits/rollbacks).
* ⏰ **Async Task Monitoring:** Built-in support for Celery, Django-Q, RQ, and APScheduler.
* 🔴 **Redis & Cache:** Detailed monitoring of hits/misses and raw Redis operations (GET, SET, DEL).
* 📁 **Storage Operations:** Track file saves, reads, and deletes across Local and S3 storage.
* 📧 **Communications:** Outgoing API request monitoring (HTTP Client), Mail capture, and Django Signals dispatch.
* 🛡️ **Security & Logic:** Transparent auditing for Authorization checks (Gates/Permissions).
* 📊 **Mission Control:** A real-time dashboard featuring Apdex scores, performance percentiles, and a modular Health System.

**🔌 Architecture & Reliability**

Django Orbit is built on a **Plug-and-Play system**. Each watcher operates independently with graceful degradation: if a specific module fails, it auto-disables while both your main application and the rest of Orbit continue running smoothly.

Many modern high-performance Python tools now rely on Rust under the hood. Projects like Polars, Ruff, Pydantic v2, orjson, and Hugging Face Tokenizers expose clean Python APIs while using Rust for their performance-critical parts.

I built **awesome-python-rs** to track and discover these projects in one place — a curated list of Python tools, libraries, and frameworks with meaningful Rust components.

# What My Project Does

Maintains a curated list of:

* Python libraries and frameworks powered by Rust
* Developer tools using Rust for speed and safety
* Data, ML, web, and infra tools with Rust execution engines

Only projects with a **meaningful Rust component** are included (not thin wrappers around C libraries).

# Target Audience

Python developers who:

* Care about performance and reliability
* Are curious how modern Python tools achieve their speed
* Want examples of successful Python + Rust integrations
* Are exploring PyO3, maturin, or writing Rust extensions

# Comparison

Unlike general “awesome” lists for Python or Rust, this list is specifically focused on the intersection of the two: Python-facing projects where Rust is a core implementation language. The goal is to make this trend visible and easy to explore in one place.

You describe your objects. diwire builds the graph.

The core features:

* Type-driven resolution from annotations (no manual bindings for the common case)
* Scoped lifetimes (app / request / custom)
* Async-first (async factories, async resolution)
* Generator-based cleanup (yield dependencies, get teardown for free)
* Open generics support
* compile() step to remove runtime reflection on hot paths (DI without perf tax)

Tiny example:

    from dataclasses import dataclass
    from diwire import Container
    
    @dataclass
    class Repo:
        ...
    
    @dataclass
    class Service:
        repo: Repo
    
    container = Container()
    service = container.resolve(Service)

That's it. No registrations needed.

I'm looking for honest feedback, especially from people who have used DI in Python (or strongly dislike it):

* API ergonomics: registration, scopes, overrides
* Typing edge cases: Protocols, generics, Annotated metadata
* What you personally expect from a ""Pythonic"" DI container

1qubf75,RevoDraw - Draw custom images on Revolut card designs using ADB and OpenCV,LeoGFN,Python,2026-02-02T17:27:29,2,0.76,0,"RevoDraw is a Python tool that lets you draw custom images on Revolut's card customization screen (the freeform drawing mode). It provides a web UI where you can:

* Upload any image and convert it to drawable paths using edge detection (Canny, contours, adaptive thresholding)
* Automatically detect the drawing boundaries from a phone screenshot using OpenCV
* Preview, position, scale, rotate, and erase parts of your image
* Execute the drawing on your phone via ADB swipe commands

The tool captures a screenshot via ADB, uses Hough line transforms to detect the dotted-line drawing boundaries (which form an L-shape with two exclusion zones), then converts your image to paths and sends `adb shell input swipe` commands to trace them.

**Target Audience**

This is a fun side project / toy for Revolut users who want custom card designs without drawing by hand. It's also a decent example of practical OpenCV usage (edge detection, line detection, contour extraction) combined with ADB automation.

**Comparison**

I couldn't find any existing tools that do this. The alternatives are:

* Drawing by hand on your phone (tedious, imprecise)
* Using Revolut's preset designs (limited options)

1qucvkm,Axiomeer: Open-source marketplace protocol for AI agents (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + Ollama),AutoProspectAI,Python,2026-02-02T18:27:26,1,0.57,2,"    I open-sourced Axiomeer, a marketplace where AI agents can discover and consume tools with built-in trust and validation. Wanted to share the architecture and get feedback from the Python community.
    
    **What it does:**
    - Providers register products via JSON manifests (any HTTP endpoint that returns structured JSON)
    - Agents shop the marketplace using natural language or capability tags
    - Router scores apps by capability match (70%), latency (20%), cost (10%)
    - Output is validated: citations checked, timestamps verified
    - Evidence quality is assessed deterministically (no LLM) -- mock/fake data is flagged
    - Every execution logged as an immutable receipt
    
    **Stack:**
    - FastAPI + Uvicorn for the API
    - SQLAlchemy 2.0 + SQLite for storage
    - Pydantic v2 for all request/response models
    - Typer + Rich for the CLI
    - Ollama for local LLM inference (capability extraction, answer generation)
    - pytest (67 tests)
    
    **How it differs from MCP:** MCP standardizes connecting to a specific tool server. Axiomeer adds the marketplace layer -- which tool, from which provider, and can you trust what came back? They're complementary.
    
    This is a v1 prototype with real providers (Open-Meteo weather, Wikipedia) and mock providers for testing. Looking for contributors to expand the provider catalog. Adding a new provider is ~30 lines + a manifest.

1qtrnkx,I built Fixpoint: A deterministic security auto-patcher for Python PRs (No AI / Open Source),ZarifLatif,Python,2026-02-02T04:37:57,14,0.82,1,"I’ve spent too many hours in the 'ping-pong' loop between security scanners and PR reviews. Most tools are great at finding vulnerabilities, but they leave the tedious manual patching to the developer. I got tired of fixing the same SQLi and XSS patterns over and over, so I built **Fixpoint**—an open-source tool that automates these fixes using deterministic logic instead of AI guesswork. I’m a student developer looking for honest feedback on whether this actually makes your workflow easier or if auto-committing security fixes feels like 'too much' automation.

# What My Project Does

**Fixpoint** is an open-source tool designed to bridge the gap between security detection and remediation. It runs at pull-request time and, instead of just flagging vulnerabilities, it **applies deterministic fixes** via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) transformations.

# Target Audience

This is built for **Production DevSecOps workflows**. It’s for teams that want to eliminate security debt (SQLi, XSS, Hardcoded Secrets) without the unpredictability or ""hallucinations"" of LLM-based tools.

# Comparison

* **vs. AI-Remediation:** Fixpoint is **deterministic**. Same input results in the same output, making it fully auditable for compliance.
* **vs. Static Scanners (Bandit/Semgrep):** Those tools identify problems; Fixpoint solves them by committing secure code directly to your branch.

# Technical Highlights

* **Safety First:** Includes 119 passing tests and built-in loop prevention for GitHub Actions.
* **Dual Modes:** **Warn** (PR comments) or **Enforce** (Direct commits).
* **Performance:** Scans only changed files (PR-diff) to minimize CI/CD overhead.

Firstly, let me thank you all for the response on the [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qno6hj/gopdfsuit_v400_a_highperformance_pdf_engine_for/). After chatting with some of you, I realized that while the community loved the speed, some were hesitant about running an extra microservice. In this update, we’ve addressed that head-on with official Python bindings.

# What My Project Does

GoPdfSuit is a high-performance PDF generation engine that decouples design from code. Instead of writing layout logic (x, y coordinates) inside your Python scripts, you use a **Visual Drag-and-Drop Editor** to design your PDF. The editor exports a JSON template, and the GoPdfSuit engine (now available as a Python package) merges your data into that template to generate PDFs at native Go speeds.

**Key Features in v4.2.0:**

* **Official Python Bindings:** You can now leverage the power of Go directly within your Pythonic workflows—no sidecar container required.
* **Vector SVG Support:** Native support for embedding SVG images, perfect for high-quality branding and charts.
* **Sophisticated Text Wrapping:** The engine handles complex wrapping logic automatically to ensure content fits your defined boundaries.
* **Visual Editor Enhancements:** A React-based drag-and-drop editor for live previews.

# Target Audience

It is suitable for both small-scale scripts and high-volume production environments.

We now offer two approaches based on your needs:

1. **The Library Approach (New):** For developers who want to `pip install` a package and keep everything in their Python environment. The heavy lifting is done by the Go core via bindings.
2. **The Service Approach:** For high-volume production apps (1,000+ PDFs/min). You can deploy the engine as a standalone container on GCP Cloud Run or AWS Lambda to prevent PDF generation from blocking your main Python app's event loop.

# Comparison

If you've used **ReportLab** or **JasperReports**, you likely know the pain of manually coding `x, y` coordinates for every line and logo.

* **vs. ReportLab:** ReportLab often requires extensive boilerplate code to define layouts, making maintenance a nightmare when designs change. GoPdfSuit solves this by using a **Visual Editor** and JSON templates. If the layout needs to change, you update the JSON—**zero Python code changes required.**
* **vs. Pure Python Libraries:** GoPdfSuit's core engine is built in Go, offering performance that pure Python libraries typically can't touch.
   * *Average generation time:* \~13.7ms
   * *PDF Size:* \~130 KB (highly optimized)
* **Compliance:** Unlike many lightweight tools, we have built-in support for **PDF/UA-2 (Accessibility)** and **PDF/A (Archival)**.

1qtylzk,Stelvio: Ship Python to AWS,sebst,Python,2026-02-02T09:48:10,0,0.36,0,"# What My Project Does

Stelvio is a **Python framework and CLI** that lets you define and deploy AWS infrastructure **entirely in Python**, with sensible defaults and minimal configuration. You write Python code to declare resources like **Lambda functions**, **API Gateway routes**, **DynamoDB tables**, and Stelvio handles the heavy lifting, such as IAM roles, API stages, environment isolations, and deployments, so you don’t have to write YAML, JSON, or HCL.

Unlike traditional IaC tools, Stelvio aims to make cloud deployments feel like writing regular Python code, letting developers stay productive without needing deep AWS expertise.

# Target Audience

Stelvio is designed for:

* **Python developers** who want a smoother way to build and deploy serverless AWS apps (APIs, Lambdas, DynamoDB, etc.).
* **Teams and side-projects** where you prefer to stay within the Python ecosystem rather than juggle multiple languages or config formats.
* **Production usage** is possible, but keep in mind it’s in **early, active development**—APIs can evolve, and there may be gaps in advanced AWS features.

# Comparison

Here’s how Stelvio stands out compared to other tools:

* **vs Terraform:** Stelvio is Python-native: no HCL, modules, or external DSL, so you stay in a single language you already know.
* **vs AWS CDK:** CDK is flexible but verbose and can require a lot of AWS expertise. Stelvio prioritises **zero setup and smart defaults** to reduce boilerplate.
* **vs Pulumi:** Stelvio uses Pulumi under the hood but seeks a simpler, more opinionated experience tailored to Python serverless apps, while Pulumi itself covers multi-cloud and multi-language use cases.

1qtxusk,[Showcase] AgentSwarm: A framework that treats AI agents as strongly typed functions,LucaBoris88,Python,2026-02-02T09:19:53,0,0.31,2,"Hi everyone! I'd like to share **AgentSwarm**, a Python framework I've been developing to bring software engineering best practices (like strong typing and functional isolation) to the world of Multi-Agent Systems.

# What My Project Does

AgentSwarm is an orchestration framework that moves away from the ""infinite chat history"" model. Instead, it treats agents as **pure, asynchronous functions**.

* **Agent-as-a-Function:** You define agents by inheriting from `BaseAgent[Input, Output]`. Every input and output is a Pydantic model.
* **Automatic Schema Generation:** It automatically generates JSON schemas for LLM tool-calling directly from your Python type hints. No manual boilerplate.
* **Tabula Rasa Execution:** To solve ""Context Pollution,"" each agent starts with a clean slate. It only receives the specific typed data it needs, rather than a bloated history of previous messages.
* **Blackboard Pattern:** Agents share a Key-Value Store (Store) to exchange data references, keeping the context window light and focused.
* **Recursive Map-Reduce:** It supports native task decomposition, allowing agents to spawn sub-agents recursively and aggregate results into typed objects.

# Target Audience

AgentSwarm is designed for **developers building production-grade agentic workflows** where reliability and token efficiency are critical. It is not a ""toy"" for simple chatbots, but a tool for complex systems that require:

* Strict data validation (Pydantic).
* Predictable state management.
* Scalability across cloud environments (AWS/Google Cloud support).

# Comparison

How does it differ from existing alternatives like **LangChain** or **AutoGPT**?

1. **vs. LangChain/LangGraph:** While LangGraph uses state graphs, AgentSwarm uses a functional, recursive approach. Instead of managing a global state object that grows indefinitely, AgentSwarm enforces isolation. If an agent doesn't need a piece of data, it doesn't see it.
2. **vs. CrewAI/AutoGPT:** Most of these frameworks are ""chat-centric"" and rely on the LLM to parse long histories. AgentSwarm is ""data-centric."" It treats the LLM as a compute engine that transforms `InputModel` into `OutputModel`, significantly reducing hallucinations caused by noisy contexts.
3. **Type Safety:** Unlike many frameworks that pass around raw dictionaries, AgentSwarm uses Python Generics to ensure that your orchestration logic is type-safe at development time.

**GitHub:** [https://github.com/ai-agentswarm/agentswarm](https://github.com/ai-agentswarm/agentswarm)

I’d love to hear your thoughts on this functional approach!

1qsxie3,"KORE: A new systems language with Python syntax, Actor concurrency, and LLVM/SPIR-V output",Ephemara,Python,2026-02-01T06:43:53,21,0.63,30,"# [kore-lang](https://github.com/ephemara/kore-lang)

**What My Project Does** KORE is a self-hosting, universal programming language designed to collapse the entire software stack. It spans from low-level systems programming (no GC, direct memory control) up to high-level full-stack web development. It natively supports JSX/UI components, database ORMs, and Actor-based concurrency without needing external frameworks or build tools. It compiles to LLVM native, WASM, SPIR-V (shaders), and transpiles to Rust.

**Target Audience** Developers tired of the ""glue code"" era. It is for systems engineers who need performance, but also for full-stack web developers who want React-style UI, GraphQL, and backend logic in a single type-safe language without the JavaScript/npm ecosystem chaos.

**Comparison**

* **vs TypeScript/React:** KORE has native JSX, hooks, and state management built directly into the language syntax. No `npm install`, no Webpack, no distinct build step.
* **vs Go/Erlang:** Uses the Actor model for concurrency (perfect for WebSockets/Networking) but combines it with Rust-like memory safety.
* **vs Rust:** Offers the same ownership/borrowing guarantees but with Python's clean whitespace syntax and less ceremony.
* **vs SQL/ORMs:** Database models and query builders are first-class citizens, allowing type-safe queries without reflection or external tools.

# What is KORE?

KORE is a **self-hosting programming language** that combines the best ideas from multiple paradigms:

I have just recently released a free-to-use open source, local python implementation of a Multi Method Reinforcement Learning pipeline with no 3rd party paid requirements or sign-ups. It's as simple as clone, confugure, run. The repo contains full documentation and pipeline explanations, is made purely for consumer hardware compatibility, and works with any existing codebase or projects. 

Target Audience and Motivations:

I’m doing this because of the capability gap from industry gatekeeping and to democratize access to industry standard tooling to bring the benefits to everyone. Setup is as straightforward with extremely customizable configurations alongside the entire pipeline is one python file. It includes 6 state of the art methods chosen to properly create an industry grade pipeline for local use . It includes six reinforcement-learning methods (SFT, PPO, DPO, GRPO, SimPO, KTO, IPO), implemented in one file with yaml model and specific run pipeline configs. The inference optimizer module provides Best-of-N sampling with reranking, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for reasoning, Speculative decoding, KV-cache optimization, and Flash Attention 2 integration. Finally the 3rd module is a merging and ensembling script for rlhf which implements Task Arithmetic merging, TIES-Merging (Trim, Elect Sign & Merge), SLERP (Spherical Linear Interpolation), DARE (Drop And REscale), Model Soups.  I will comment the recommended datasets to use for a strong starter baseline.

On Discord, you can see the mutual friends you share with each user. So we can retrieve the list of all your Discord friends and turn it into a pretty cool network graph:

\- Each node is a friend.

\- Two friends are connected if they are friends with each other.

Very simple to use:

\- Find a way to get your Discord user token (your favorite search engine is your friend).

\- uvx discograph

\- Once the graph is opened, click Physics > Enabled

Target audience and motivations:

Python really is the go-to language when you know your project will mostly be a simple wrapper around existing tools. Here it's just:

\- Discord API requests (aiohttp + pydantic)

\- networkx for the graph (community detection etc.)

\- pyvis for the interactive graph

I tried to make the app as simple as possible. But there are still some hard-coded values (not interactive), such as node and font sizes, etc. I think the solution would be to inject some JavaScript, but JavaScript and I... meh.

har-capture is a library for capturing and sanitizing HAR files. It removes PII (MAC addresses, IPs, credentials, session tokens) while preserving correlation - same values hash to the same output, so you can trace a MAC address across multiple requests without knowing the actual MAC.

* Zero dependencies for core sanitization (just stdlib)
* CLI and Python API - `har-capture sanitize myfile.har` or use programmatically
* Optional Playwright-based capture

python

    from har_capture.sanitization import sanitize_har
    
    sanitized = sanitize_har(har_data)

**Target Audience**

Developers who need to share or commit HAR files without leaking sensitive data. Originally built for debugging Home Assistant integrations, but useful anywhere HAR files are shared for diagnostics.

**Comparison**

Chrome DevTools (v130+) now redacts cookies and auth headers, but misses IPs, MACs, emails, and passwords in form bodies. Google's har-sanitizer is Python 2.7 and web-only. har-capture does correlation-preserving redaction with format-preserving output (valid MAC format, RFC-reserved IP ranges, .invalid TLD for emails).

1qssh0g,"Spikard: Benchmarks vs Robyn, Litestar and FastAPI",Goldziher,Python,2026-02-01T02:00:55,11,0.73,8,"Hi Peeps,

Been a while since my last post regarding [Spikard](https://github.com/Goldziher/spikard) - a high performance, and comprehensive web toolkit written in Rust with bindings for multiple languages.

I am developing Spikard using a combination of TDD and what I think of as ""Benchmark Driven Developement"". Basically, the development is done against a large range of tests and benchmarks that are generated from fixtures - for different languages. This allows testing the bindings for Python, Ruby, PHP and Typescript using the same tests basically. 

The benchmarking methodology uses the same fixtures, but with profiling and benchmarking. This allows to identify hotspots, and optimize. As a result, Spikard is not only tested against web standards (read IETF drafts etc.), but is also extremely performant. 

So without further ado, here is the breakdown of the comparative Python benchmarks:

## Spikard Comparative Benchmarks (Python)

## TL;DR

- spikard‑python leads on average throughput in this suite.
- Validation overhead (JSON) is smallest on litestar and largest on fastapi in this run.
- spikard‑python shows the lowest average CPU and memory usage across workloads.

---

## 1) Methodology (concise + precise)

- **Environment:** GitHub Actions runner (Ubuntu Linux, x86_64, AMD EPYC 7763, 2 vCPU / 4 threads, ~15.6 GB RAM).
- **Load tool:** `oha`
- **Per‑workload settings:** 10s warmup + 10s measured, **concurrency = 100**.
- **Workloads:** standardized HTTP suite across raw and validated variants (JSON bodies, path params, query params, forms, multipart).
- **Metrics shown:** average requests/sec and mean latency per workload; CPU/memory are per‑workload measurements aggregated per framework.
- **Cold start:** **not measured**. The harness uses a warmup phase and reports steady‑state results only.
- **Note on CPU %:** values can exceed 100% because they represent utilization across multiple cores.

### Caveats

- Some frameworks lack certain workload categories (shown as “—” in tables), so totals are not perfectly symmetric.
- “Avg RPS” is an average across workloads, not a weighted score by payload size or request volume.
- CPU/memory figures are aggregated from per‑workload measurements; they are not global peak values for the full run.

---

## 2) Summary (Python‑only)

- **spikard‑python leads on throughput** across this suite.
- **Validation overhead (JSON)** is smallest on litestar and largest on fastapi in this run.
- **Resource profile:** spikard‑python shows the lowest CPU and memory averages across workloads.

### Overview

## Why is Spikard so much faster?

The answer to this question is two fold: 

1. Spikard **IS NOT** an ASGI or RSGI framework. Why? ASGI was a historical move that made sense from the Django project perspective. It allows seperating the Python app from the actual web server, same as WSGI (think gunicorn). But -- it makes no sense to continue using this pattern. Uvicorn, and even Granian (Granian alone was used in the benchmarks, since its faster than Uvicorn) add a substantial overhead. Spikard doesnt need this - it has its own webserver, and it handles concurrency out of the box using tokio, more efficiently than these.

2. Spikard does validation more efficiently by using JSON schema validation -- in Rust only -- pre-computing the schemas on first load, and then efficiently validating. Even Litestar, which uses msgspec for this, cant be as efficient in this regard.

## Does this actually mean anything in the real world?

Well, this is a subject of debate. I am sure some will comment on this post that the real bottleneck is DB load etc.

My answer to this is - while I/O constraints, such as DB load are significant, the entire point of writing async code is to allow for non-blocking and effective concurrency. The total overhead of the framework is significant - the larger the scale, the more the differences show. Sure, for a small api that gets a few hundred or thousand requests a day, this is absolutely meaningless. But this is hardly all APIs. 

Furthermore, there are other dimensions that should be considered - cold start time (when doing serverless), memory, cpu usage, etc.

Finally -- building optimal software is fun!

1qtjk1e,[Project] My first complete GUI app - File organizer with duplicate detection,Junior-Drawing636,Python,2026-02-01T21:11:07,0,0.39,4,"Built a file organizer with duplicate detection - my first complete GUI project



My Downloads folder was a disaster and I got tired of manually sorting files, so I built this.



It's a Windows desktop app that finds scattered files across your PC and organizes them automatically. The duplicate detection uses SHA256 hashing to compare files, and there's a visual review feature so you can see duplicates side-by-side before deleting.



Main features:

\- Scans Desktop/Downloads/Documents for specific file types

\- Organizes by category and extension (images/png/, videos/mp4/, etc)

\- Duplicate detection with side-by-side comparison

\- Date-based organization using EXIF data from photos

\- Dark theme GUI



The hardest part was getting threading right so the GUI doesn't freeze when scanning thousands of files.



GitHub: [https://github.com/lunagray932-ctrl/file-organizer-renamer](https://github.com/lunagray932-ctrl/file-organizer-renamer)



It's open source (MIT). Would appreciate any feedback on the code or if you find bugs.

1qsd7bn,copier-astral: Modern Python project scaffolding with the entire Astral ecosystem,_ritwiktiwari,Python,2026-01-31T14:24:38,91,0.85,37,"Hey [ r/Python ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)!

I've been using Astral's tools (uv, ruff, and now ty) for a while and got tired of setting up the same boilerplate every time. So I built [copier-astral](https://github.com/ritwiktiwari/copier-astral) — a Copier template that gives you a production-ready Python project in seconds.

# What My Project Does

Scaffolds a complete Python project with modern tooling pre-configured:

* ruff for linting + formatting (replaces black, isort, flake
* ty for type checking (Astral's new Rust-based type checker)
* pytest + hatch for testing (including multi-version matrix)
* MkDocs with Material theme + mkdocstrings
* pre-commit hooks with prek
* GitHub Actions CI/CD
* Docker support
* Typer CLI scaffold (optional)
* git-cliff for auto-generated changelogs

# Target Audience

Python developers who want a modern, opinionated starting point for new projects. Good for:

* Side projects where you don't want to spend an hour on setup
* Production code that needs proper CI/CD, testing, and docs from day one
* Anyone who's already bought into the Astral ecosystem and wants it all wired up

# Comparison

The main difference from similar tools I’ve seen is that this one is built on Copier (which supports template updates) and fully embraces Astral’s toolchain—including ty for type checking, an optional Typer CLI scaffold, prek (a significantly faster, Rust-based alternative to pre-commit) for command-line projects, and git-cliff for generating changelogs from Conventional Commits.

# Quick start:

pip install copier copier-template-extensions

copier copy --trust gh:ritwiktiwari/copier-astral my-project

# What My Project Does

It's a simple transpiler that let's you write in pandas-like syntax and get SQL as the output. It supports most of BigQuery ""Standard SQL"" functions.

# Target Audience

It is a production ready solution. At least I started using it at work :)

# Comparison

I've seen some projects that do that in reverse (translate sql to pandas syntax but haven't found one that does pandas to sql)

I wanted something like this. I'm ML Engineer working in Google Cloud environment, big chunk of the data we train on is in BigQuery so the most efficient way of preparing training data is running complex queries there, pulling output into dataframe and doing some final touches. I don't like putting complex SQL in repos so I thought I will try something like this.

1qsfhg6,Python tool that analyzes your system's hardware and determines which AI models you can run locally.,Punk_Saint,Python,2026-01-31T15:53:44,33,0.68,15,"GitHub: [https://github.com/Ssenseii/ariana](https://github.com/Ssenseii/ariana)  
  
**What My Project Does**

AI Model Capability Analyzer is a Python tool that inspects your system’s hardware and tells you **which AI models you can realistically run locally**.

It automatically:

* Detects CPU, RAM, GPU(s), and available disk space
* Fetches metadata for **200+ AI models** (from Ollama and related sources)
* Compares your system resources against each model’s requirements
* Generates a **detailed compatibility report** with recommendations

The goal is to remove the guesswork around questions like *“Can my machine run this model?”* or *“Which models should I try first?”*

After running the tool, you get a report showing:

* How many models your system supports
* Which ones are a good fit
* Suggested optimizations (quantization, GPU usage, etc.)

**Target Audience**

This project is primarily for:

* Developers experimenting with **local LLMs**
* People new to running AI models on consumer hardware
* Anyone deciding **which models are worth downloading** before wasting bandwidth and disk space

It’s **not meant for production scheduling or benchmarking**. Think of it as a practical analysis and learning tool rather than a deployment solution.

**Comparison**

Compared to existing alternatives:

* **Ollama** tells you *how* to run models, but not *which ones your hardware can handle*
* **Hardware requirement tables** are usually static, incomplete, or model-specific
* **Manual checking** requires juggling VRAM, RAM, quantization, and disk estimates yourself

This tool:

* Centralizes model data
* Automates system inspection
* Provides a single compatibility view tailored to *your* machine

It doesn’t replace benchmarks, but it **dramatically shortens the trial-and-error phase**.

**Key Features**

* Automatic hardware detection (CPU, RAM, GPU, disk)
* 200+ supported models (Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Gemma, Code models, Vision models, embeddings)
* NVIDIA & AMD GPU support (including multi-GPU systems)
* Compatibility scoring based on real resource constraints
* Human-readable report output (`ai_capability_report.txt`)

**Example Output**

    ✓ CPU: 12 cores
    ✓ RAM: 31.11 GB available
    ✓ GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 Ti (15.93 GB VRAM)
    
    ✓ Retrieved 217 AI models
    ✓ You can run 158 out of 217 models
    ✓ Report generated: ai_capability_report.txt

**How It Works (High Level)**

1. Analyze system hardware
2. Fetch AI model requirements (parameters, quantization, RAM/VRAM, disk)
3. Score compatibility based on available resources
4. Generate recommendations and optimization tips

**Tech Stack**

* Python 3.7+
* psutil, requests, BeautifulSoup
* GPUtil (GPU detection)
* WMI (Windows support)

Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**.

**Limitations**

* Compatibility scores are estimates, not guarantees
* VRAM detection can vary depending on drivers and OS
* Optimized mainly for NVIDIA and AMD GPUs

Actual performance still depends on model implementation, drivers, and system load.

1qsl2hx,NumThy: computational number theory in pure Python,Particular_Bag_3424,Python,2026-01-31T19:48:09,9,0.85,7,"Hey guys!

For anybody interested in computational number theory, I've put together a little compilation of some my favorite algorithms, some stuff you rarely see implemented in Python. I wanted to share it, so I threw it together in a single-file mini-library. You know, ""*one file to rule them all*"" type vibes.

I'm calling it *NumThy*: [github.com/ini/numthy](https://github.com/ini/numthy)

Demo: [ini.github.io/numthy/demo](https://ini.github.io/numthy/demo/)

It's pure Python, no dependencies, so you can literally drop it in anywhere. I also tried to make the implementations as clear as I could, complete with paper citations and complexity analysis, so a reader going through it could learn from it. The code is basically supposed to read like an ""executable textbook"".

**Target Audience:** Anyone interested in number theory, CTF crypto challenges, competitive programming / Project Euler ...

**What My Project Does:**

* Extra-strong variant of the Baillie-PSW primality test
* Lagarias-Miller-Odlyzko (LMO) algorithm for prime counting, generalized to sums over primes of any arbitrary completely multiplicative function
* Two-stage Lenstra's ECM factorization with Montgomery curves and Suyama parametrization
* Self-initializing quadratic sieve (SIQS) with triple-large-prime variation
* Cantor-Zassenhaus → Hensel lifting → Chinese Remainder Theorem pipeline for finding modular roots of polynomials
* Adleman-Manders-Miller algorithm for general n-th roots over finite fields
* General solver for all binary quadratic Diophantine equations (ax² + bxy + cy² + dx + ey + f = 0)
* Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm with automatic precision escalation
* Jochemsz-May generalization of Coppersmith's method for multivariate polynomials with any number of variables
* and more

1qsdsit,Typedkafka - A typed Kafka wrapper to make my own life easier,anoraxian,Python,2026-01-31T14:47:39,15,0.79,6,"The last two years I have spent way too much time working with Kafka in Python. Mostly confluent-kafka, though I've also had the displeasure of encountering some stuff on kafka-python. Both have the same fundamental problem which is that you're basically coding blind.

There are no type hints. There are barely any docstrings. Half the methods have signatures that just say `*args, **kwargs` and you're left wondering what the hell you're supposed to pass in. This means that you're doomed to read librdkafka C docs and try to map C parameter names back to whatever Python is expecting.

So today, on my precious weekend, I got fed up enough to do something about it. I built a wrapper called *typedkafka* that sits on top of *confluent-kafka* and adds everything I wished it had from the start. Which frankly is just proper type hints and docstrings on every public method.

**What My Project Does**

Wraps confluent-kafka with full type hints and docstrings so your IDE knows how to help you. It also adds a proper exception hierarchy, mock clients which enables unit tests of your Kafka code without spinning up a broker, and built-in support for transactions, async, retry, and serialization.

**Target Audience**

Anyone who's using confluent-kafka and has experienced the same frustrations as me.

**Comparison**

*types-confluent-kafka* is a type stubs package. It adds annotations so mypy stops complaining, but it doesn't give you docstrings, doesn't change the exceptions, and doesn't help with testing.

*faust / faust-streaming* is a stream processing framework. If you just want to produce and consume messages with a clean typed API, I'd argue that it's overkill. The difference here is that typedkafka is just trying to make basic Kafka interactions much easier.

1qsdbph,I built a library for safe nested dict traversal with pattern matching,logophage,Python,2026-01-31T14:29:17,14,0.68,15,"**What My Project Does**

dotted is a library for safe nested data traversal with pattern matching. Instead of chaining `.get()` calls or wrapping everything in try/except:

    # Before
    val = d.get('users', {}).get('data', [{}])[0].get('profile', {}).get('email')

    # After
    val = dotted.get(d, 'users.data[0].profile.email')

It supports wildcards, regex patterns, filters with boolean logic, in-place mutation, and inline transforms:

    import dotted

    # Wildcards - get all emails
    dotted.get(d, 'users.data[*].profile.email')
    # → ('alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com')

    # Regex patterns
    dotted.get(d, 'users./.*_id/')
    # → matches user_id, account_id, etc.

    # Filters with boolean logic
    dotted.get(users, '[status=""active""&!role=""admin""]')
    # → active non-admins

    # Mutation
    dotted.update(d, 'users.data[*].verified', True)
    dotted.remove(d, 'users.data[*].password')

    # Inline transforms
    dotted.get(d, 'price|float')  # → 99.99

One neat trick - check if a field is **missing** (not just None):

    data = [
        {'name': 'alice', 'email': 'a@x.com'},
        {'name': 'bob'},  # no email field
        {'name': 'charlie', 'email': None},
    ]

    dotted.get(data, '[!email=*]')   # → [{'name': 'bob'}]
    dotted.get(data, '[email=None]') # → [{'name': 'charlie', 'email': None}]

**Target Audience**

Production-ready. Useful for anyone working with nested JSON/dict structures - API responses, config files, document databases. I use it in production for processing webhook payloads and navigating complex API responses.

1qsqvjk,I’ve been working on a Python automation tool and wanted to share it,adamj495,Python,2026-02-01T00:28:45,10,0.56,20,"I’ve been working on a tool called **CronioPy** for almost a year now and figured I’d share it here in case it’s useful to anyone: [https://www.croniopy.com](https://www.croniopy.com)

**What it does:**  
CronioPy runs your Python, JS, and SQL scripts on AWS automatically in a scheduler or workflow with no DevOps, no containers, no infra setup. If you’ve ever had a script that works locally but is annoying to deploy, schedule, or monitor, that’s exactly the problem it solves.

**What’s different about it:**

* Runs your code inside isolated AWS containers automatically
* Handles scheduling, retries, logging, and packaging for you
* Supports Python, JavaScript, and SQL workflows
* Great for ETL jobs, alerts, reports, LLM workflows, or any “cron‑job‑that-got-out-of-hand”
* Simple UI for writing, running, and monitoring jobs
* Built for teams that don’t have (or don’t want) DevOps overhead

**Target Audience**: This is a production software for businesses that is meant as a potential alternative to AWS, Azure, or GCP. The idea is that AWS can be very complicated and often requires resources to manage the infrastructure... CronioPy eliminates that as it is a plug and play software that anyone can use.

It is an Airflow Light but with a simpler UI and already connect to AWS.

**Why I built it:**  
Most teams write Python or SQL every day, but deploying and running that code in production is way harder than it should be. Airflow and Step Functions are overkill for simple jobs, and rolling your own cron server is… fragile. I wanted something that “just works” without needing to manage infrastructure.

It’s free for up to 1,000 runs per month, which should cover most personal projects. If anyone ends up using it and wants to support the project, I’m happy to give out a 2‑month free upgrade to the Pro or Business tier -  just DM me.

**What My Project Does**  
It’s a local web application that scans a directory for media files and helps you clean them up. Key features:  
1. **Smart Deduplication**: Uses a 3-stage hashing process (Size -> Partial Hash -> Full Hash) to identify identical files efficiently.  
2. **Semantic Search**: Uses OpenAI's **CLIP** model running locally to let you search your images with text (e.g., find all ""receipts"", ""memes"", or ""blurry images"") without manual tagging.  
3. **Safe Cleanup**: Provides a web interface to review duplicates and deletes files by moving them to the Trash (not permanent deletion).  
  
  
**Target Audience**  
This is for:  
\- **Data Hoarders**: People with massive local libraries of photos/videos who are overwhelmed by duplicates.  
\- **Developers**: Anyone interested in how to implement local AI (CLIP) or efficient file processing in Python.  
\- **Privacy-Conscious Users**: Since it runs 100% locally/offline, it's for people who don't want to upload their personal photos to cloud cleaners.  
  
  
**Comparison**

\- **vs dupeGuru/Czkawka**: This project differs by adding \*\*Semantic Search\*\*. While those tools find exact/visual duplicates, this tool allows you to find \*concepts\* (like ""screenshots"" or ""documents"") to bulk delete ""junk"" that isn't necessarily a duplicate.  
\- **vs Commercial Cloud Tools**: Unlike Gemini Photos or other cloud apps, this runs entirely on your machine, so you don't pay subscription fees or risk privacy.

The community response has been amazing: 1,100+ stars on GitHub and 19,000+ downloads.

If you haven't seen Servy before, it's a Windows tool that turns any Python app (or other executable) into a native Windows service. You just set the Python executable path, add your script and arguments, choose the startup type, working directory, and environment variables, configure any optional parameters, click install, and you're done. Servy comes with a desktop app, a CLI, PowerShell integration, and a manager app for monitoring services in real time.

In this release (5.9), I've added/improved:

* New [Console tab](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/wiki/Overview#console) to display real-time service `stdout` and `stderr` output
* Pre-stop and post-stop hooks ([\#36](https://github.com/aelassas/servy/issues/36))
* Optimized CPU and RAM graphs performance and rendering
* Keep the Service Control Manager (SCM) responsive during long-running process termination
* Improve shutdown logic for complex process trees
* Prevent orphaned/zombie child processes when the parent process is force-killed
* Bug fixes and expanded documentation

We built Codestory CLI to solve this. It is an open-source tool that partitions your work into clean, logical commits automatically using semantic analysis and AI. We designed it so you can mix and match changes at will, filtering out debug logs or stripping leaked secrets while keeping everything else.

**Target Audience:** We believe you should not have to choose between moving fast and being disciplined. This is for developers who want to maintain a clean, reviewable map of how a project evolved, not a graveyard of WIP messages.

**Comparison:** The biggest fear with tools that touch your codebase is whether they will break the code. With Codestory, that is impossible. We are Index Only.

Our tool is completely sandboxed. We only modify the git index (the recording of your history), never your actual source files. Your working directory stays untouched, and your history only updates if the entire pipeline succeeds.

1qsjy4i,EZThrottle (Python): Coordinating requests instead of retrying under rate limits,Noobcreate,Python,2026-01-31T18:58:56,0,0.18,4,"# What My Project Does

EZThrottle is a Python SDK that replaces local retry loops (sleep, backoff, jitter) with **centralized request coordination**.

Instead of each coroutine or worker independently retrying when it hits a 429, requests are **queued and admitted centrally**. Python services don’t thrash, sleep, or spin — they simply wait until it’s safe to send.

The goal is to make failure *boring* by handling rate limits and backpressure **outside** application logic, especially in async and fan-out workloads.



# Target Audience

This project is intended for:

* Python backend engineers
* Async / event-driven services (FastAPI, asyncio, background workers, agents)
* Systems that frequently hit downstream 429s or shared rate limits
* People who are uncomfortable with retry storms and cascading failures

It is **early-stage** and experimental, not yet production-hardened.  
Right now, it’s best suited for:

* exploration
* testing alternative designs
* validating whether coordination beats retries in real Python services



# Comparison

**Traditional approach**

* Each request retries independently
* Uses sleep, backoff, jitter
* Assumes failures are local
* Can amplify load under high concurrency
* Retry logic leaks into application code everywhere

**EZThrottle approach**

* Treats rate limiting as a coordination problem
* Centralizes admission control
* Requests wait instead of retrying
* No sleep/backoff loops in application code
* Plays naturally with Python’s async/event-driven model

Rather than optimizing retries, the project asks whether retries are the **wrong abstraction** for shared downstream limits.



# Additional Context

I wrote more about the motivation and system-level thinking here:  
[https://www.ezthrottle.network/blog/making-failure-boring-again](https://www.ezthrottle.network/blog/making-failure-boring-again?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Python SDK:  
[https://github.com/rjpruitt16/ezthrottle-python](https://github.com/rjpruitt16/ezthrottle-python)

I’m mainly looking for feedback from Python engineers:

small config changes that suddenly block merges

1qsdj5a,Announcing MCPHero - a Python package that maps MCP servers with native OpenAI clients.,stepacool,Python,2026-01-31T14:37:26,0,0.33,0,"The package is [https://pypi.org/project/mcphero/](https://pypi.org/project/mcphero/)

Github [https://github.com/stepacool/mcphero/](https://github.com/stepacool/mcphero/)

  
Problem:

* MCP servers exist
* Native `openai` / `gemini` clients don’t support MCP
* As a result, many people just don’t use MCP at all

What this library does:

* Converts MCP tools into OpenAI-compatible tools/functions
* Sends the LLM tool call result back to the MCP server for execution
* Returns updated message history

Example:

    tools = await adapter.get_tool_definitions()
    response = client.chat.completions.create(..., tools=tools)
    
    tool_calls = response.choices[0].message.tool_calls
    result = await adapter.process_tool_calls(tool_calls) 

The target audience is anyone who is using AI but not agentic libraries, as agentic libraries do support mcp\_servers natively. This lets you keep up with them.

The only alternative I could find was fastmcp as a framework, but their client part doesn't really do that.

1qs5y3f,Introduced a tool turning software architecture into versioned and queryable data,MatchLittle5000,Python,2026-01-31T09:55:18,0,0.33,0,"**Code:** https://github.com/pacta-dev/pacta-cli

**Docs:** https://pacta-dev.github.io/pacta-cli/getting-started/

## What My Project Does

Pacta is aimed to version, test, and observe software architecture over time.

With pacta you are able to:

1. **Take architecture snapshots:** version your architecture like code
2. **View history and trends**: how dependencies, coupling, and violations evolve
3. **Do diffs between snapshots:** like Git commits
4. **Get metrics and insights**: build charts catching modules, dependencies, violations, and coupling
5. **Define rules & governance**: architectural intent you can enforce incrementally
6. **Use baseline mode**: adopt governance without being blocked by legacy debt

It helps teams understand how architecture evolves and prevent slow architectural decay.

## Target Audience

This is aimed at real-world codebases.

Best fit: engineers/architectures maintaining modular systems (including legacy).

## Comparison

Pacta adds history, trends, and snapshot diffs for architecture over time, whereas linters (like Import Linter or ArchUnit) focus on the current state.

Rule testing tools are not good enough adapted to legacy systems. Pacta supports baseline mode, so you can prevent new violations without fixing the entire past first.

This tool is Git + tests + metrics for architecture.

---

## Brief Guide

1. Install and define your architecture model:

```bash
pip install pacta
```

Create an `architecture.yml` describing your architecture.

2. Save a snapshot of the current state:

```bash
pacta snapshot save . --model architecture.yml
```

3. Inspect history:

```bash
pacta history show --last 5
```

Example:

```
TIMESTAMP            SNAPSHOT    NODES  EDGES  VIOLATIONS
2024-01-22 14:30:00  f7a3c2...   48     82     0
2024-01-15 10:00:00  abc123...   45     78     0
```

Track trends (e.g., dependency count / edges):

```bash
pacta history trends . --metric edges
```

Example:

```
Edge Count Trend (5 entries)
============================

 82 │                              ●
    │               ●--------------
 79 │    ●----------
    │
 76 ├●---
    └────────────────────────────────
      Jan 15                   Jan 22

Trend: ↑ Increasing (+6 over period)
First: 76 edges (Jan 15)
Last:  82 edges (Jan 22)

Average: 79 edges
Min: 76, Max: 82
```

4. Enforce architectural rules (`rules.pacta.yml`):

```bash
# Option A: Check an existing snapshot
pacta check . --rules rules.pacta.yml

# Option B: Snapshot + check in one step
pacta scan . --model architecture.yml --rules rules.pacta.yml
```

Example violation output:

```
✗ 2 violations (2 error) [2 new]

  ✗ ERROR [no_domain_to_infra] @ src/domain/user.py:3:1
    status: new
    Domain layer must not import from Infrastructure

1qrjdxc,Any projects to break out of the oop structure?,hermitvirgin69,Python,2026-01-30T15:56:43,13,0.69,29,"Hey there,

I've been programming for a while now (still suck) with languages like java and python. These are my comfort languages but I'm having difficulty breaking out of my shell and trying projects that really push me. With java, I primarily use it for robotics and small videogames but it feels rather clunky with having to setup a virtual machine and other small nuances that just get in the way of MY program (not sure if I explained that properly). Still though, it was my first language that I learned so I feel safe coding with it. Ever since I started coding with python (which I really like compared to dealing with java) all of my projects, whether that be simulations, games, math stuff, stick to that oop java structure because that's what I started with and that just seems to be the most organized to me. However, there is always room for improvement and I definitely want to try new programming structures or ways to organize code. Is oop the best? Is oop just for beginners? What other kinds of programming structures are there?

1qs7crk,[Bug Fix] Connection pool exhaustion in httpcore when TLS handshake fails over HTTP proxy,AFNM_BZ,Python,2026-01-31T10:47:55,0,0.38,1,"Hi all,

I ran into a nasty connection pool exhaustion issue when using httpx with an HTTP proxy to reach HTTPS services: after running for a while, all requests would throw PoolTimeout, even though the proxy itself was perfectly healthy (verified via browser).

After tracing through httpx and the underlying httpcore, I found the root cause: when a CONNECT tunnel succeeds but the subsequent TLS handshake fails, the connection object remains stuck in ACTIVE state—neither reusable nor cleaned up by the pool, eventually creating ""zombie connections"" that fill the entire pool.

I've submitted a fix and would appreciate community feedback:

PR: [https://github.com/encode/httpcore/pull/1049](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/pull/1049)

Below is my full analysis, focusing on httpcore's state machine transitions and exception handling boundaries.

**Deep Dive: State Machine and Exception Flow Analysis**

To trace the root cause of PoolTimeout, I started from AsyncHTTPProxy and stepped through httpcore's request lifecycle line by line.

**Connection Pool Scheduling and Implementation Details**

AsyncHTTPProxy inherits from AsyncConnectionPool:

`class AsyncHTTPProxy(AsyncConnectionPool):`  
`""""""`  
`A connection pool that sends requests via an HTTP proxy.`  
`""""""`  
When a request enters the connection pool, it triggers AsyncConnectionPool.handle\_async\_request. This method enqueues the request and enters a while True loop waiting for connection assignment:

`#  AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`while True:`  
`with self._optional_thread_lock:`  
`# Assign incoming requests to available connections,`  
`# closing or creating new connections as required.`  
`closing = self._assign_requests_to_connections()`  
`await self._close_connections(closing)`  
  
`# Wait until this request has an assigned connection.`  
`connection = await pool_request.wait_for_connection(timeout=timeout)`  
  
`try:`  
`# Send the request on the assigned connection.`  
`response = await connection.handle_async_request(`  
`pool_request.request`  
`)`  
`except ConnectionNotAvailable:`  
`# In some cases a connection may initially be available to`  
`# handle a request, but then become unavailable.`  
`#`  
`# In this case we clear the connection and try again.`  
`pool_request.clear_connection()`  
`else:`  
`break  # pragma: nocover`  
`...`

The logic here: if connection acquisition fails or becomes unavailable, the pool retries via ConnectionNotAvailable exception; otherwise it returns the response normally.

The core scheduling logic lives in \_assign\_requests\_to\_connections. On the first request, since the pool is empty, it enters the branch that creates a new connection:

`#  AsyncConnectionPool._assign_requests_to_connections`  
`...`  
`if available_connections:`  
`# log: ""reusing existing connection""`  
`connection = available_connections[0]`  
`pool_request.assign_to_connection(connection)`  
`elif len(self._connections) < self._max_connections:`  
`# log: ""creating new connection""`  
`connection = self.create_connection(origin)`  
`self._connections.append(connection)`  
`pool_request.assign_to_connection(connection)`  
`elif idle_connections:`  
`# log: ""closing idle connection""`  
`connection = idle_connections[0]`  
`self._connections.remove(connection)`  
`closing_connections.append(connection)`  
`# log: ""creating new connection""`  
`connection = self.create_connection(origin)`  
`self._connections.append(connection)`  
`pool_request.assign_to_connection(connection)`  
`...`

Note that although AsyncConnectionPool defines create\_connection, AsyncHTTPProxy overrides this method to return AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection instances specifically designed for proxy tunneling, rather than direct connections.

`def create_connection(self, origin: Origin) -> AsyncConnectionInterface:`  
`if origin.scheme == b""http"":`  
`return AsyncForwardHTTPConnection(`  
`proxy_origin=self._proxy_url.origin,`  
`proxy_headers=self._proxy_headers,`  
`remote_origin=origin,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`network_backend=self._network_backend,`  
`proxy_ssl_context=self._proxy_ssl_context,`  
`)`  
`return AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection(`  
`proxy_origin=self._proxy_url.origin,`  
`proxy_headers=self._proxy_headers,`  
`remote_origin=origin,`  
`ssl_context=self._ssl_context,`  
`proxy_ssl_context=self._proxy_ssl_context,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`http1=self._http1,`  
`http2=self._http2,`  
`network_backend=self._network_backend,`  
`)`

For HTTPS requests, create\_connection returns an AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection instance. At this point only the object is instantiated; the actual TCP connection and TLS handshake have not yet occurred.

**Tunnel Establishment Phase**

Back in the main loop of AsyncConnectionPool.handle\_async\_request. After \_assign\_requests\_to\_connections creates and assigns the connection, the code waits for the connection to become ready, then enters the try block to execute the actual request:

`#  AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`connection = await pool_request.wait_for_connection(timeout=timeout)`  
  
`try:`  
`# Send the request on the assigned connection.`  
`response = await connection.handle_async_request(`  
`pool_request.request`  
`)`  
`except ConnectionNotAvailable:`  
`# In some cases a connection may initially be available to`  
`# handle a request, but then become unavailable.`  
`#`  
`# In this case we clear the connection and try again.`  
`pool_request.clear_connection()`  
`else:`  
`break  # pragma: nocover`  
`...`

Here, connection is the AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection instance created in the previous step. connection.handle\_async\_request enters the second-level logic.

`#  AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`# Assign incoming requests to available connections,`  
`# closing or creating new connections as required.`                      
`closing = self._assign_requests_to_connections()`  
`await self._close_connections(closing)`  
`...`

The closing list returned by \_assign\_requests\_to\_connections is empty—no expired connections to clean up on first creation. The request is then dispatched to the AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection instance, entering its handle\_async\_request method.

`#  AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`# Wait until this request has an assigned connection.`  
`connection = await pool_request.wait_for_connection(timeout=timeout)`  
  
`try:`  
`# Send the request on the assigned connection.`  
`response = await connection.handle_async_request(`  
`pool_request.request`  
`)`  
`...`

connection.handle\_async\_request is AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle\_async\_request. This method first checks the self.\_connected flag: for new connections, it constructs an HTTP CONNECT request and sends it to the proxy server.

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with self._connect_lock:`  
`if not self._connected:`  
`target = b""%b:%d"" % (self._remote_origin.host, self._remote_origin.port)`  
  
`connect_url = URL(`  
`scheme=self._proxy_origin.scheme,`  
`host=self._proxy_origin.host,`  
`port=self._proxy_origin.port,`  
`target=target,`  
`)`  
`connect_headers = merge_headers(`  
`[(b""Host"", target), (b""Accept"", b""*/*"")], self._proxy_headers`  
`)`  
`connect_request = Request(`  
`method=b""CONNECT"",`  
`url=connect_url,`  
`headers=connect_headers,`  
`extensions=request.extensions,`  
`)`  
`connect_response = await self._connection.handle_async_request(`  
`connect_request`  
`)`  
`...`

The CONNECT request is sent via self.\_connection.handle\_async\_request(). The self.\_connection here is initialized in AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection's init.

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.__init__`  
`...`  
`self._connection: AsyncConnectionInterface = AsyncHTTPConnection(`  
`origin=proxy_origin,`  
`keepalive_expiry=keepalive_expiry,`  
`network_backend=network_backend,`  
`socket_options=socket_options,`  
`ssl_context=proxy_ssl_context,`  
`)`  
`...`

self.\_connection is an AsyncHTTPConnection instance (defined in connection.py). When its handle\_async\_request is invoked to send the CONNECT request, the execution actually spans two levels of delegation:

**Level 1: Lazy Connection Establishment**

AsyncHTTPConnection.handle\_async\_request first checks if the underlying connection exists. If not, it executes \_connect() first, then instantiates the actual protocol handler based on ALPN negotiation:  
`#  AsyncHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with self._request_lock:`  
`if self._connection is None:`  
`stream = await self._connect(request)`  
  
`ssl_object = stream.get_extra_info(""ssl_object"")`  
`http2_negotiated = (`  
`ssl_object is not None`  
`and ssl_object.selected_alpn_protocol() == ""h2""`  
`)`  
`if http2_negotiated or (self._http2 and not self._http1):`  
`from .http2 import AsyncHTTP2Connection`  
  
`self._connection = AsyncHTTP2Connection(`  
`origin=self._origin,`  
`stream=stream,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`)`  
`else:`  
`self._connection = AsyncHTTP11Connection(`  
`origin=self._origin,`  
`stream=stream,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`)`  
`...`

Note that self.\_connection is now assigned to an AsyncHTTP11Connection (or HTTP/2) instance.

**Level 2: Protocol Handling and State Transition**

AsyncHTTPConnection then delegates the request to the newly created AsyncHTTP11Connection instance:

`#  AsyncHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`return await self._connection.handle_async_request(request)`  
`...`

Inside AsyncHTTP11Connection, the constructor initializes self.\_state = HTTPConnectionState.NEW. In the handle\_async\_request method, the state is transitioned to ACTIVE — this is the core of the subsequent issue:

`#  AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with self._state_lock:`  
`if self._state in (HTTPConnectionState.NEW, HTTPConnectionState.IDLE):`  
`self._request_count += 1`  
`self._state = HTTPConnectionState.ACTIVE`  
`self._expire_at = None`  
`else:`  
`raise ConnectionNotAvailable()`  
`...`

In this method, after request/response headers are processed, handle\_async\_request returns Response. Note the content parameter is HTTP11ConnectionByteStream(self, request):

`#  AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`return Response(`  
`status=status,`  
`headers=headers,`  
`content=HTTP11ConnectionByteStream(self, request),`  
`extensions={`  
`""http_version"": http_version,`  
`""reason_phrase"": reason_phrase,`  
`""network_stream"": network_stream,`  
`},`  
`)`  
`...`

This uses a deferred cleanup pattern: the connection remains ACTIVE when response headers are returned. Response body reading and state transition (to IDLE) are postponed until HTTP11ConnectionByteStream.aclose() is invoked.

At this point, the Response propagates upward with the connection in ACTIVE state. All connection classes in httpcore implement handle\_async\_request returning Response, following **the uniform interface pattern**.

Back in AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle\_async\_request:

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`connect_response = await self._connection.handle_async_request(`  
`connect_request`  
`)`  
`...`

Next, check the CONNECT response status. If non-2xx, aclose() is correctly invoked for cleanup:

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`if connect_response.status < 200 or connect_response.status > 299:`  
`reason_bytes = connect_response.extensions.get(""reason_phrase"", b"""")`  
`reason_str = reason_bytes.decode(""ascii"", errors=""ignore"")`  
`msg = ""%d %s"" % (connect_response.status, reason_str)`  
`await self._connection.aclose()`  
`raise ProxyError(msg)`  
  
`stream = connect_response.extensions[""network_stream""]`  
`...`

If CONNECT succeeds (200), the raw network stream is extracted from response extensions for the subsequent TLS handshake.

Here's where the bug occurs. Original code:

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with Trace(""start_tls"", logger, request, kwargs) as trace:`  
`stream = await stream.start_tls(**kwargs)`  
`trace.return_value = stream`  
`...`

This stream.start\_tls() establishes the TLS tunnel to the target server.

**Tracing the origin of stream requires peeling back several layers.**

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

stream comes from connect\_response.extensions\[""network\_stream""\]. In the CONNECT request handling flow, this value is set by AsyncHTTP11Connection when returning the Response:

`#  AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`return Response(`  
`status=status,`  
`headers=headers,`  
`content=HTTP11ConnectionByteStream(self, request),`  
`extensions={`  
`""http_version"": http_version,`  
`""reason_phrase"": reason_phrase,`  
`""network_stream"": network_stream,`  
`},`  
`)`  
`...`

Specifically, after AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle\_async\_request() processes the CONNECT request, it wraps the underlying \_network\_stream as AsyncHTTP11UpgradeStream and places it in the response extensions.

`#  AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`network_stream = self._network_stream`  
  
`# CONNECT or Upgrade request`  
`if (status == 101) or (`  
`(request.method == b""CONNECT"") and (200 <= status < 300)`  
`):`  
`network_stream = AsyncHTTP11UpgradeStream(network_stream, trailing_data)`  
`...`

Here self.\_network\_stream comes from AsyncHTTP11Connection's constructor:

`#  AsyncHTTP11Connection.__init__`  
`...`  
`self._network_stream = stream`  
`...`

And this stream is passed in by AsyncHTTPConnection when creating the AsyncHTTP11Connection instance.

This occurs in AsyncHTTPConnection.handle\_async\_request. The \_connect() method creates the raw network stream, then the protocol is selected based on ALPN negotiation:

`#  AsyncHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with self._request_lock:`  
`if self._connection is None:`  
`stream = await self._connect(request)`  
  
`ssl_object = stream.get_extra_info(""ssl_object"")`  
`http2_negotiated = (`  
`ssl_object is not None`  
`and ssl_object.selected_alpn_protocol() == ""h2""`  
`)`  
`if http2_negotiated or (self._http2 and not self._http1):`  
`from .http2 import AsyncHTTP2Connection`  
  
`self._connection = AsyncHTTP2Connection(`  
`origin=self._origin,`  
`stream=stream,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`)`  
`else:`  
`self._connection = AsyncHTTP11Connection(`  
`origin=self._origin,`  
`stream=stream,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`)`  
`...`

***Fine***

The stream passed from AsyncHTTPConnection to AsyncHTTP11Connection comes from self.\_connect(). This method creates the raw TCP connection via self.\_network\_backend.connect\_tcp():  
`#  AsyncHTTPConnection._connect`  
`...`  
`stream = await self._network_backend.connect_tcp(**kwargs)`  
`...`  
`async with Trace(""start_tls"", logger, request, kwargs) as trace:`  
`stream = await stream.start_tls(**kwargs)`  
`trace.return_value = stream`  
`return stream`  
`...`

Note: if the proxy protocol is HTTPS, \_connect() internally completes the TLS handshake with the proxy first (the first start\_tls call), then returns the encrypted stream.

self.\_network\_backend is initialized in the constructor, defaulting to AutoBackend:

`#  AsyncHTTPConnection.__init__`  
`...`  
`self._network_backend: AsyncNetworkBackend = (`  
`AutoBackend() if network_backend is None else network_backend`  
`)`  
`...`

AutoBackend is an adapter that selects the actual backend (AnyIO or Trio) at runtime:

`#  AutoBackend.connect_tcp`  
`async def connect_tcp(`  
`self,`  
`host: str,`  
`port: int,`  
`timeout: float | None = None,`  
`local_address: str | None = None,`  
`socket_options: typing.Iterable[SOCKET_OPTION] | None = None,`  
`) -> AsyncNetworkStream:`  
`await self._init_backend()`  
`return await self._backend.connect_tcp(`  
`host,`  
`port,`  
`timeout=timeout,`  
`local_address=local_address,`  
`socket_options=socket_options,`  
`)`

Actual network I/O is performed by \_backend (e.g., AnyIOBackend).

The \_init\_backend method detects the current async library environment, defaulting to AnyIOBackend:

`#  AutoBackend._init_backend`  
`async def _init_backend(self) -> None:`  
`if not (hasattr(self, ""_backend"")):`  
`backend = current_async_library()`  
`if backend == ""trio"":`  
`from .trio import TrioBackend`  
  
`self._backend: AsyncNetworkBackend = TrioBackend()`  
`else:`  
`from .anyio import AnyIOBackend`  
  
`self._backend = AnyIOBackend()`

Thus, the actual return value of AutoBackend.connect\_tcp() comes from AnyIOBackend.connect\_tcp().

AnyIOBackend.connect\_tcp() ultimately returns an AnyIOStream object:

`#  AnyIOBackend.connect_tcp`  
`...`  
`return AnyIOStream(stream)`  
`...`

This object propagates back up to AsyncHTTPConnection.\_connect().

`#  AsyncHTTPConnection._connect`  
`...`  
`stream = await self._network_backend.connect_tcp(**kwargs)`  
`...`  
`if self._origin.scheme in (b""https"", b""wss""):`  
`...`  
`async with Trace(""start_tls"", logger, request, kwargs) as trace:`  
`stream = await stream.start_tls(**kwargs)`  
`trace.return_value = stream`  
`return stream`  
`...`

Note: if the proxy uses HTTPS, \_connect() first performs start\_tls() to establish TLS with the proxy (not the target). The returned stream is already TLS-wrapped. For HTTP proxies, the raw stream is returned directly.  
Notably, AnyIOStream.start\_tls() automatically calls self.aclose() on exception to close the underlying socket.(see PR [https://github.com/encode/httpcore/pull/475](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/pull/475), respect)

`#  AnyIOStream.start_tls`  
`...`  
`try:`  
`with anyio.fail_after(timeout):`  
`ssl_stream = await anyio.streams.tls.TLSStream.wrap(`  
`self._stream,`  
`ssl_context=ssl_context,`  
`hostname=server_hostname,`  
`standard_compatible=False,`  
`server_side=False,`  
`)`  
`except Exception as exc:  # pragma: nocover`  
`await self.aclose()`  
`raise exc`  
`return AnyIOStream(ssl_stream)`  
`...`  
The AnyIOStream then returns to AsyncHTTPConnection.handle\_async\_request, and is ultimately passed as the stream argument to AsyncHTTP11Connection's constructor.

`#  AsyncHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with self._request_lock:`  
`if self._connection is None:`  
`stream = await self._connect(request)`  
  
`ssl_object = stream.get_extra_info(""ssl_object"")`  
`http2_negotiated = (`  
`ssl_object is not None`  
`and ssl_object.selected_alpn_protocol() == ""h2""`  
`)`  
`if http2_negotiated or (self._http2 and not self._http1):`  
`from .http2 import AsyncHTTP2Connection`  
  
`self._connection = AsyncHTTP2Connection(`  
`origin=self._origin,`  
`stream=stream,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`)`  
`else:`  
`self._connection = AsyncHTTP11Connection(`  
`origin=self._origin,`  
`stream=stream,`  
`keepalive_expiry=self._keepalive_expiry,`  
`)`  
`...`

***D.C. al Fine***

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Having traced the complete origin of stream, we return to the core issue:

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with Trace(""start_tls"", logger, request, kwargs) as trace:`  
`stream = await stream.start_tls(**kwargs)`  
`trace.return_value = stream`  
`...`

At this point, the TCP connection to the proxy is established and CONNECT has returned 200. stream.start\_tls() initiates TLS with the target server. This stream is the AnyIOStream traced earlier — its start\_tls() does call self.aclose() on exception to close the underlying socket, but **this cleanup only happens at the transport layer.**

**Exception Handling Boundary Gap**

In normal request processing, httpcore establishes multiple layers of exception protection. AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle\_async\_request uses an outer try-except block to ensure: whether network exceptions occur during request sending or response header reception, \_response\_closed() is called to transition \_state from ACTIVE to CLOSED or IDLE.

`#  AsyncHTTP11Connection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`except BaseException as exc:`  
`with AsyncShieldCancellation():`  
`async with Trace(""response_closed"", logger, request) as trace:`  
`await self._response_closed()`  
`raise exc`  
`...`

AsyncHTTPConnection also has protection, but its scope only covers TCP connection establishment and until the CONNECT request returns.

`#  AsyncHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`except BaseException as exc:`  
`self._connect_failed = True`  
`raise exc`  
`...`

However, in AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle\_async\_request's proxy tunnel establishment flow, **the control flow has a structural break**:

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`connect_response = await self._connection.handle_async_request(`  
`connect_request`  
`)`  
`...`

At this point AsyncHTTP11Connection.\_state has been set to ACTIVE. If the CONNECT request is rejected (e.g., 407 authentication required), the code correctly calls aclose() for cleanup:

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`if connect_response.status < 200 or connect_response.status > 299:`  
`reason_bytes = connect_response.extensions.get(""reason_phrase"", b"""")`  
`reason_str = reason_bytes.decode(""ascii"", errors=""ignore"")`  
`msg = ""%d %s"" % (connect_response.status, reason_str)`  
`await self._connection.aclose()`  
`raise ProxyError(msg)`  
`...`

But if CONNECT succeeds with 200 and the subsequent TLS handshake fails, there is no corresponding exception handling path.

`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`async with Trace(""start_tls"", logger, request, kwargs) as trace:`  
`stream = await stream.start_tls(**kwargs)`  
`trace.return_value = stream`  
`...`

As described earlier, stream is an AnyIOStream object. When stream.start\_tls() is called, if an exception occurs, AnyIOStream.start\_tls() closes the underlying socket. But this cleanup only happens at the network layer — the upper AsyncHTTP11Connection remains unaware, its \_state still ACTIVE; meanwhile AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection does not catch this exception to trigger self.\_connection.aclose().

This creates a permanent disconnect between HTTP layer state and network layer reality: when TLS handshake fails, the exception propagates upward with no code path to transition \_state from ACTIVE to CLOSED, resulting in a zombie connection.

**The exception continues propagating upward, reaching AsyncConnectionPool at the top of the call stack:**

`#  AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`try:`  
`# Send the request on the assigned connection.`  
`response = await connection.handle_async_request(`  
`pool_request.request`  
`)`  
`except ConnectionNotAvailable:`  
`# In some cases a connection may initially be available to`  
`# handle a request, but then become unavailable.`  
`#`  
`# In this case we clear the connection and try again.`  
`pool_request.clear_connection()`  
`else:`  
`break  # pragma: nocover`  
`...`

Only ConnectionNotAvailable is caught here for retry logic. The Error from TLS handshake failure propagates uncaught.

`#  AsyncConnectionPool.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`except BaseException as exc:`  
`with self._optional_thread_lock:`  
`# For any exception or cancellation we remove the request from`  
`# the queue, and then re-assign requests to connections.`  
`self._requests.remove(pool_request)`  
`closing = self._assign_requests_to_connections()`  
  
`await self._close_connections(closing)`  
`raise exc from None`  
`...`

Here \_assign\_requests\_to\_connections() iterates the pool to determine which connections to close. It checks connection.is\_closed() and connection.has\_expired():

`#  AsyncConnectionPool._assign_requests_to_connections`  
`...`  
`# First we handle cleaning up any connections that are closed,`  
`# have expired their keep-alive, or surplus idle connections.`  
`for connection in list(self._connections):`  
`if connection.is_closed():`  
`# log: ""removing closed connection""`  
`self._connections.remove(connection)`  
`elif connection.has_expired():`  
`# log: ""closing expired connection""`  
`self._connections.remove(connection)`  
`closing_connections.append(connection)`  
`elif (`  
`connection.is_idle()`  
`and sum(connection.is_idle() for connection in self._connections)`  
`> self._max_keepalive_connections`  
`):`  
`# log: ""closing idle connection""`  
`self._connections.remove(connection)`  
`closing_connections.append(connection)`  
`...`

Here connection is the AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection instance from earlier. These methods are delegated through the chain: AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection → AsyncHTTPConnection → AsyncHTTP11Connection.

\- is\_closed() → False (\_state == ACTIVE)

\- has\_expired() → False (only checks readability when \_state == IDLE)

Thus, even when the exception reaches the top level, AsyncConnectionPool cannot identify this disconnected connection and can only re-raise the exception.

**Is there any layer above?**

I don't think so. The raise exc from None in the except BaseException block is the final exit point, with the exception thrown directly to user code calling httpcore (such as httpx or the application layer). And the higher the exception propagates, the further it detaches from the original connection object's context — this should not be considered reasonable.

**Fix**

The root cause is clear: when TLS handshake fails, the exception propagation path lacks explicit cleanup of the AsyncHTTP11Connection state.

The fix is simple — add exception handling around the TLS handshake to ensure the connection is closed on failure:  
`#  AsyncTunnelHTTPConnection.handle_async_request`  
`...`  
`try:`  
`async with Trace(""start_tls"", logger, request, kwargs) as trace:`  
`stream = await stream.start_tls(**kwargs)`  
`trace.return_value = stream`  
`except Exception:`  
`# Close the underlying connection when TLS handshake fails to avoid`  
`# zombie connections occupying the connection pool`  
`await self._connection.aclose()`  
`raise`  
`...`

This await self.\_connection.aclose() forcibly transitions AsyncHTTP11Connection.\_state from ACTIVE to CLOSED, allowing the pool's is\_closed() check to correctly identify it for removal during the next \_assign\_requests\_to\_connections() call.

**Summary**

Through this analysis, I gained a clearer understanding of httpcore's layered architecture. The unique aspect of this scenario is that it sits precisely at the intersection of multiple abstraction layers — the TCP connection to the proxy is established, the HTTP request is complete, but the TLS upgrade to the target address has not yet succeeded. At this point, the exception propagation path crosses the boundaries of Stream → Connection → Pool, where the complexity of state synchronization increases significantly.

Such issues are not uncommon in async networking: ensuring that state is correctly synchronized across every exit path when control is delegated between objects is a systemic challenge. My fix simply completes the state cleanup logic for this specific path within the existing exception handling framework.

I built this because I wanted a clean WiFi manager for my Arch setup. Most tools felt clunky or terminal-only.

What it does:

• Scans available networks with auto-refresh  
• Connects to secured and open networks  
• Shows detailed network info (IP address, gateway, DNS servers, signal strength, frequency, security type)  
• Lets you forget and disconnect from networks  
• Toggles WiFi on/off

**Target Audience**  
Built for Arch/minimal Linux users who want more visibility and control than typical GUIs, without relying entirely on terminal-only tools. Usable for personal setups; also a learning-focused project.

**Comparison**  
Unlike nmcli or iwctl, airctl prioritizes readability and quick insight over pure CLI workflows. Compared to NetworkManager GUIs, it’s lighter, simpler, and exposes more useful network details instead of hiding them.

I built a DataFrame-style query engine on top of SQLAlchemy that lets you write SQL queries using the same patterns you’d use in **PySpark, Pandas, or Polars**. Instead of writing raw SQL or ORM-style code, you compose queries using a familiar DataFrame interface, and Moltres translates that into SQL via SQLAlchemy.

**Target Audience:**

Data Scientists, Data Analysts, and Backend Developers who are comfortable working with DataFrames and want a more expressive, composable way to build SQL queries.

Works like SQLAlchemy, but with a **DataFrame-first API** — think writing Spark/Polars-style transformations that compile down to SQL.

1qrk7s2,"I built a standalone, offline OCR tool because existing wrappers couldn't handle High-DPI screens",Wolklaw,Python,2026-01-30T16:28:13,5,0.77,10,"**What My Project Does** QuickOCR is a `tkinter`\-based desktop utility that allows users to capture any region of their screen and instantly convert the image to text on their clipboard. It bundles a full Tesseract engine internally, meaning it runs as a single portable `.exe` without requiring the user to install Tesseract or configure environment variables. It specifically solves the problem of extracting text from ""unselectable"" UIs like remote desktop sessions, game HUDs, or error dialogs.

**Target Audience** This tool is meant for:

* **System Administrators & IT Staff:** Who need to rip error codes from locked-down remote sessions where installing software is prohibited.
* **Gamers:** Who need to copy text from ""holographic"" or transparent game UIs (like Star Citizen or MMOs).
* **Developers:** Looking for a reference on how to handle Windows High-DPI awareness in Python `tkinter` applications.

**Comparison** How it differs from existing alternatives:

* **vs. Cloud APIs (Google Vision/Azure):** QuickOCR runs 100% offline. No data is sent to the cloud, making it safe for sensitive corporate environments.
* **vs. Raw** `pytesseract` **scripts:** Most simple wrappers fail on High-DPI screens (150%+ scaling), causing the capture zone to drift. QuickOCR uses `ctypes` to map the virtual screen coordinates perfectly to the physical pixels.
* **vs. Capture2Text:** QuickOCR includes a custom ""Anti-Holographic"" pre-processing pipeline (Upscaling -> Inversion -> Binarization) specifically tuned for reading text on noisy or transparent backgrounds, which older tools often miss.

**Technical Details (The ""Secret Sauce"")**

1. **High-DPI Fix:** I used `ctypes.windll.shcore.SetProcessDpiAwareness(1)` combined with `GetSystemMetrics(78)` to ensure the overlay covers all monitors correctly, regardless of their individual scaling settings.
2. **Portable Bundling:** The executable is \~86MB because I used PyInstaller to bundle the **entire** Tesseract binary and language models inside the `_MEIPASS` temp directory.

1qr944d,TyPy: An open-source Python interpreter in .NET focused on sandboxed execution,TyphonBvB,Python,2026-01-30T09:49:40,5,1.0,1,"ello r/Python,

I’ve decided to open-source **TyPy**, a Python interpreter written in **.NET**, designed to safely execute **untrusted Python code** with strong observability and control over execution.

# What My Project Does

TyPy is a Python interpreter that executes Python bytecode using only managed .NET code. It is designed for environments where Python code must be executed safely, predictably, and under strict runtime constraints.

Its primary goals are to:

* Enforce predefined **CPU and memory limits** when running untrusted Python code
* Provide **clean interop with host .NET code and objects**
* Run **multiple isolated Python virtual machines concurrently**, with controlled sharing of host data
* Enable detailed **observability and execution control** over Python execution

# Target Audience

This project is intended for developers who need to execute **user-provided or untrusted Python code** in a controlled environment. Typical use cases include educational platforms, automation sandboxes, simulations, and games.

TyPy is not intended to be a drop-in replacement for CPython and prioritizes **control, isolation, and safety** over full language compatibility or peak performance.

# Comparison

Compared to **CPython** or **PyPy**, TyPy focuses on sandboxed execution and strict resource enforcement rather than performance or ecosystem completeness.  
Unlike embedding CPython, TyPy executes Python bytecode entirely in managed .NET code and is designed to support multiple concurrent, isolated Python VMs within a single host process.

# Context: About the Game

TyPy was originally developed to power **Typhon: Bot vs Bot**, a programming-focused game where players write **real Python code** to control autonomous units in a simulated environment. The game context drove requirements such as deterministic execution, strong sandboxing guarantees, and fine-grained runtime control.

While TyPy was built for this game, the interpreter itself is **engine-agnostic** and released as a standalone open-source library.

1qrees2,Real-time Face Distance Estimation: Sub-400ms inference using FastAPI + InsightFace (SCRFD) on CPU,htone22,Python,2026-01-30T12:54:40,0,0.33,0,"**What My Project Does**
This is a real-time computer vision backend that detects faces and estimates user distance from the camera directly in the browser. It processes video frames sent via HTTP multipart requests, runs inference using the InsightFace (SCRFD) model, and returns coordinates + distance logic in under 400ms.

It is designed to run on standard serverless CPU containers (like Railway) without needing expensive GPUs.

**Target Audience**
This is for developers interested in building privacy-first Computer Vision apps who want to avoid the cost and latency of external cloud APIs (like AWS Rekognition). It is useful for anyone trying to implement ""liveness"" checks or proximity detection in a standard web stack (Next.js + Python).

**Comparison**
Unlike using a cloud API (which adds network latency and costs per call), this solution runs the inference entirely in-memory on the backend instance.
* **Vs. Cloud APIs:** Zero per-request cost, lower latency (no external API roundtrips).
* **Vs. OpenCV Haar Cascades:** Significantly higher accuracy and robustness to lighting/angles (thanks to the SCRFD model).
* **Performance:** Achieves ~400ms round-trip latency on a basic CPU instance, handling image decoding and inference without disk I/O.

**The Stack**
* **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.9)
* **Inference:** InsightFace (SCRFD model)
* **Frontend:** Next.js 16

1qqj5vd,Rethinking the IDE: Moving from text files to a graph-based IDE,yared12qw,Python,2026-01-29T13:55:46,36,0.67,26,"# What My Project Does

V‑NOC (Virtual Node Code) is a graph‑based IDE designed to reduce the chaos of working with large codebases. It introduces an abstraction layer on top of traditional files, giving developers greater flexibility in how they view and navigate code.

Files are mainly meant for storage and are not very flexible. V‑NOC turns code into nodes and treats each function or class as its own piece. Using dynamic analysis, it automatically builds call graphs and brings related functions together in one place. This removes the need to jump between many files. This lets developers focus on one function or component at a time, even if it is inside a large file. It is like working with hardware. If a power supply breaks, you isolate it and fix the power supply by itself without worrying about the other parts. In the same way, V‑NOC lets developers work on one part of the code without being distracted by the rest.

Documentation and logs are attached directly to nodes, so you do not have to search for documentation that may or may not exist or may be buried somewhere else in different title. When you open a function or class, its code, documentation, and relevant runtime information are shown together side by side.

This also makes it easier for LLMs to work with large codebases. When working on one feature or one function, the LLM does not need to search for related information or collect unnecessary context. Because most things are already connected, the relevant data is already there and can be accessed with a simple query. Since documentation lives next to the code, the LLM can read the documentation directly instead of trying to understand everything from the code alone. This helps reduce hallucinations. Rules can also be attached to specific functions, so the LLM does not need to consume unrelated context.

# Target Audience

V‑NOC is currently a working prototype. It mostly works as intended, but it is not production‑ready yet and still needs improvements in performance and some refinement in the UI and workflow.

The project is intended for:

* All developers, especially those working with large or long‑lived codebases
* Developers who need to understand, explore, or learn unfamiliar codebases quickly
* Teams onboarding new contributors to complex systems
* Anyone interested in alternative IDE concepts and developer‑experience tooling
* LLM‑based tools and agents that need structured, precise access to code instead of raw text

The goal is to make complex systems easier to understand and reason about  whether the “user” is a human developer or an AI agent.

# Comparison to Existing Tools

Most traditional tools provide raw data that is scattered across different places and platforms. They rely on the programmer to collect everything and give it meaning. This takes a lot of mental energy, and most of the time is spent trying to understand the code instead of fixing bugs. Some tools rely heavily on AI to connect and reason over this scattered information, which adds extra cost, increases the risk of hallucinations, and makes the results hard to verify.

Many of these tools only offer a chat interface to hide the complexity. This is a bad approach. It is like hiding trash under the bed. It looks clean at first, but the mess keeps growing until it causes problems, and the developer slowly loses control.

V‑NOC does not hide complexity or details. Instead, it makes them easier to see and understand, so developers stay in control of their code.

1qpq3cc,(Rant) AI is killing programming and the Python community,Fragrant_Ad3054,Python,2026-01-28T16:24:43,1663,0.88,438,"I'm sorry but it has to come out.

We are experiencing an endless sleep paralysis and it is getting worse and worse.

Before, when we wanted to code in Python, it was simple: either we read the documentation and available resources, or we asked the community for help, roughly that was it.

The advantage was that stupidly copying/pasting code often led to errors, so you had to take the time to understand, review, modify and test your program.

Since the arrival of ChatGPT-type AI, programming has taken a completely different turn.

We see new coders appear with a few months of experience in programming with Python who give us projects of 2000 lines of code with an absent version manager (no rigor in the development and maintenance of the code), comments always boats that smell the AI from miles around, a .md boat also where we always find this logic specific to the AI and especially a program that is not understood by its own developer.

I have been coding in Python for 8 years, I am 100% self-taught and yet I am stunned by the deplorable quality of some AI-doped projects.

In fact, we are witnessing a massive arrival of new projects that are basically super cool and that are in the end absolutely null because we realize that the developer does not even master the subject he deals with in his program, he understands that 30% of his code, the code is not optimized at all and there are more ""import"" lines than algorithms thought and thought out for this project.

I see it and I see it personally in the science given in Python where the devs will design a project that by default is interesting, but by analyzing the repository we discover that the project is strongly inspired by another project which, by the way, was itself inspired by another project. I mean, being inspired is ok, but here we are more in cloning than in the creation of a project with real added value.

So in 2026 we find ourselves with posts from people with a super innovative and technical project that even a senior dev would have trouble developing alone and looking more closely it sounds hollow, the performance is chaotic, security on some projects has become optional. the program has a null optimization that uses multithreads without knowing what it is or why. At this point, reverse engineering will no longer even need specialized software as the errors will be aberrant. I'm not even talking about the optimization of SQL queries that makes you dizzy.

Finally, you will have understood, I am disgusted by this minority (I hope) of dev who are boosted with AI.

AI is good, but you have to know how to use it intelligently and with hindsight and a critical mind, but some take it for a senior Python dev.

Subreddits like this are essential, and I hope that devs will continue to take the time to inquire by exploring community posts instead of systematically choosing ease and giving blind trust to an AI chat.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpq3cc/rant_ai_is_killing_programming_and_the_python/,Meta,True,0,False,2101,0.05282287157287154,neutral,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-28 16:24:43,16,Wednesday
1qqjbep,PyCon US grants free booth space and conference passes to early-stage startups. Apply by Feb 1,jrowley,Python,2026-01-29T14:01:22,8,0.79,0,"For the past 10 years I’ve been a volunteer organizer of [Startup Row](https://us.pycon.org/2026/attend/startup-row/) at PyCon US, and I wanted to let all the entrepreneurs and early-stage startup employees know that applications for free booth space at PyCon US close at the end of this weekend. (The webpage says this Friday, but I can assure you that the web form will stay up through the weekend.)

There’s a lot of information on the Startup Row page on the PyCon US website, and a post on the [PyCon blog](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2026/01/apply-for-pycon-startup-row-2026.html) if you’re interested. But I figured I’d summarize it all in the form of an FAQ.

**What is Startup Row at PyCon US?**

Since 2011 the Python Software Foundation and conference organizers have reserved booth space for early-stage startups at PyCon US. It is, in short, a row of booths for startups building cool things with Python. Companies can apply for booth space on Startup Row and recipients are selected through a competitive review process. The selection committee consists mostly of startup founders that have previously presented on Startup Row.

**How to I apply?**

The “[Submit your application here!](https://us.pycon.org/2026/applications/apply/startup-row/)” button at the bottom of the Startup Row page will take you to the application form.

There are a half-dozen questions that you’ve probably already answered if you’ve applied to any sort of incubator, accelerator, or startup competition.

You will need to create a PyCon US login first, but that takes only a minute.

**Deadline?**

Technically the webpage says applications close on Friday January 30th. The web form will remain active through this weekend.

Our goal is to give companies a final decision on their application status by mid-February, which is plenty of time to book your travel and sort out logistics.

**What does my company get if selected to be on Startup Row?**

At no cost to them, Startup Row companies receive:

* Two included conference passes, with additional passes available for your team at a discount.
* Booth space in the Expo Hall on Startup Row for the Opening Reception on the evening of Thursday May 14th and for both days of the main conference, Friday May 15th and Saturday May 16th.
* Optionally: A table at the PyCon US Job Fair on Sunday May 17th. (If you’re company is hiring Python talent, there is likely nowhere better than PyCon US for technical recruiting.)
* Placement on the PyCon US 2026 website and a profile on the PyCon US blog (where you’re reading this post)
* Eternal glory

Basically, getting a spot on Startup Row gives your company the same experience as a paying sponsor of PyCon at no cost. Teams are still responsible for flights, hotels, and whatever materials you bring for your booth.

**What are the eligibility requirements?**

Pretty simple:

* You have to use Python somewhere in your stack, the more the better.
* Company is less than 2.5 years old (either from founding or from public launch)
* Has 25 or fewer employees
* Has not already presented on Startup Row or sponsored PyCon US. (Founders who previously applied but weren’t selected are welcome to apply again. Alumni founders working on new companies are also welcome to apply.)

Apart from the ""use Python somewhere"" rule, all the other criteria are somewhat fuzzy.

1qraodv,denial: when None is no longer sufficient,pomponchik,Python,2026-01-30T10:45:25,0,0.39,19,"Hello [r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/)! 👋

Some time ago, I wrote a library called [skelet](https://github.com/pomponchik/skelet), which is something between built-in `dataclasses` and `pydantic`. And there I encountered a problem: in some cases, I needed to distinguish between situations where a *value is undefined* and situations where it is *defined as undefined*. I delved a little deeper into [the problem](https://github.com/pomponchik/denial?tab=readme-ov-file#the-problem), studied what [other solutions existed](https://github.com/pomponchik/denial?tab=readme-ov-file#analogues), and realized that none of them suited me for a number of reasons. In the end, I had to write my own.

As a result of my search, I ended up with the [denial](https://github.com/pomponchik/denial) package. Here's how you can install it:

    pip install denial

Let's move on to how it works.

# What My Project Does

Python has a built-in [sentinel object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentinel_value) called `None`. It's enough for most cases, but sometimes you might need a second similar value, like `undefined` in JavaScript. In those cases, use `InnerNone` from `denial`:

    from denial import InnerNone
    
    print(InnerNone == InnerNone)
    #> True

The `InnerNone` object is equal only to itself.

In more complex cases, you may need more sentinels, and in this case you need to create new objects of type `InnerNoneType`:

    from denial import InnerNoneType
    
    sentinel = InnerNoneType()
    
    print(sentinel == sentinel)
    #> True
    print(sentinel == InnerNoneType())
    #> False

As you can see, each `InnerNoneType` object is also equal only to itself.

# Target Audience

This project is not intended for most programmers who write “product” production code. It is intended for those who create their own libraries, which typically wrap some user data, where problems sometimes arise that require custom sentinel objects.

Such tasks are not uncommon; at least [15 such places](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/python-dev@python.org/message/JBYXQH3NV3YBF7P2HLHB5CD6V3GVTY55/) can be found in the standard library.

# Comparison

In addition to `denial`, there are many packages with sentinels in [`Pypi`](https://pypi.org/). For example, there is the [sentinel](https://pypi.org/project/sentinel/) library, but its API seemed to me overcomplicated for such a simple task. The [sentinels](https://pypi.org/project/sentinels/) package is quite simple, but in its internal implementation it also relies on the [global registry](https://github.com/vmalloc/sentinels/blob/37e67ed20d99aa7492e52316e9af7f930b9ac578/sentinels/__init__.py#L11) and contains some other code defects. The [sentinel-value](https://github.com/vdmit11/sentinel-value) package is very similar to `denial`, but I did not see the possibility of autogenerating sentinel ids there. Of course, there are other packages that I haven't reviewed here.

1qqh7yb,Retries and circuit breakers as failure policies in Python,qiaoshiya,Python,2026-01-29T12:46:23,4,0.76,4,"**What My Project Does**

Retries and circuit breakers are often treated as separate concerns with one library for retries (if not just spinning your own retry loops) and another for breakers. Each one with its own knobs and semantics.

I've found that before deciding *how* to respond (retry, fail fast, trip a breaker), it's best to decide *what kind of failure occurred*. 

I've been working on a small Python library called [redress](https://github.com/aponysus/redress) that implements this idea by treating retries and circuit breakers as **policy responses to classified failure**, not separate mechanisms. 

Failures are mapped to a small set of semantic error classes (RATE_LIMIT, SERVER_ERROR, TRANSIENT, etc.). Policies then decide how to respond to each class in a bounded, observable way. 

Here's an example using a unified policy that includes both retry and circuit breaking (neither of which are necessary if the user just wants sensible defaults):

    from redress import Policy, Retry, CircuitBreaker, ErrorClass, default_classifier
    from redress.strategies import decorrelated_jitter
    
    policy = Policy(
        retry=Retry(
            classifier=default_classifier,
            strategy=decorrelated_jitter(max_s=5.0),
            deadline_s=60.0,
            max_attempts=6,
        ),
        # Fail fast when the upstream is persistently unhealthy
        circuit_breaker=CircuitBreaker(
            failure_threshold=5,
            window_s=60.0,
            recovery_timeout_s=30.0,
            trip_on={ErrorClass.SERVER_ERROR, ErrorClass.CONCURRENCY},
        ),
    )
    
    result = policy.call(lambda: do_work(), operation=""sync_op"")
    
Retries and circuit breakers share the same classification, lifecycle, and observability hooks. When a policy stops retrying or trips a breaker, it does so far an explicit reason that can be surfaced directly to metrics and/or logs. 

The goal is to make failure handling explicit, bounded, and diagnosable.


**Target Audience**

This project is intended for production use in Python services where retry behavior needs to be controlled carefully under real failure conditions.

It’s most relevant for:

* backend or platform engineers
* services calling unreliable upstreams (HTTP APIs, databases, queues)
* teams that want retries and circuit breaking to be bounded and observable
* It’s likely overkill if you just need a simple decorator with a fixed backoff.

**Comparison**

Most Python retry libraries focus on how to retry (decorators, backoff math), and treat all failures similarly or apply one global strategy.

redress is different.  It classifies failures first, before deciding how to respond, allows per-error-class retry strategies, treatsretries and circuit breakers as part of the same policy model, and emits structured lifecycle events so retry and breaker decisions are observable.

I’ve been working on an open-source Python package called **InvestorMate** that some of you might find useful if you work with market data, fundamentals, or financial analysis in Python.

It’s not meant to replace low-level data providers like Yahoo Finance — it sits a layer *above* that and focuses on turning market + financial data into **analysis-ready objects**.

**What it currently does:**

* Normalised income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow data
* 60+ technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
* Auto-computed financial ratios (P/E, ROE, margins, leverage)
* Built-in financial health scores (Piotroski F, Altman Z, Beneish M)
* Stock screening (value, growth, dividend, custom filters)
* Portfolio metrics (returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio)
* Optional AI layer (OpenAI / Claude / Gemini) for:
   * Company comparisons
   * Explaining trends
   * High-level financial summaries

1qqd9e4,"Showcase: Embedded multi-model database for Python (tables + graph + vector), no server",Plastic_Director_480,Python,2026-01-29T10:27:16,2,0.67,0,"## What My Project Does

This project lets you run **ArcadeDB embedded directly inside a Python process**.

There is no client/server setup. The database runs **in-process**, fully local and offline.

It provides a single embedded engine that supports:

* tables
* documents
* graph relationships
* vector similarity search

Python controls schema, transactions, and queries directly.

Install:

```bash
uv pip install arcadedb-embedded
```

---

## Target Audience

This is intended for:

* local-first Python applications
* agent memory and tooling
* research prototypes
* developers who want embedded storage without running a separate database service

It is **not** meant as a drop-in replacement for existing relational or analytical databases, and it is not aimed at large distributed deployments.

---

## Comparison

Most Python storage options focus on **one primary data model** (e.g. relational tables or vectors).

This project explores a different trade-off:

* **embedded execution** instead of client/server
* **multiple data models in one engine**
* **single transaction boundary** across tables, graphs, and vectors

The main difference is not performance claims, but **co-locating structure, relationships, and vector search inside one embedded process**.

---

## Additional Details

* Python-first API for schema and transactions
* SQL and OpenCypher
* HNSW vector search (via JVector)
* Single standalone wheel:

  * lightweight JVM 25 (built with `jlink`)
  * required ArcadeDB JARs
  * JPype bridge


Repo: https://github.com/humemai/arcadedb-embedded-python  
Docs: https://docs.humem.ai/arcadedb/

I’m mainly looking for **technical feedback**:

* Does this embedded + multi-model approach make sense?
* Where would this be a bad fit?
* What would make the Python API feel more natural?

1qpxwk1,pip-weigh: A CLI tool to check the disk size of Python packages including their dependencies.,Character-Being2523,Python,2026-01-28T21:53:47,11,0.93,11,"## What My Project Does
pip-weigh is a command-line tool that tells you exactly how much disk space a Python package and all its dependencies will consume before you install it.
I was working with some agentic frameworks and realized that most of them felt too bloated, and i thought i might compare them but when i searched online for a tool to do this, i realized that there is no such tool atm for this. There are some tools that actually check the size of the package itself but they dont calculate the size of dependencies that come with installing those packages. So i made a cli tool for this.
Under the hood, it creates a temporary virtual environment using uv, installs the target package, parses the uv.lock file to get the full dependency tree, then calculates the actual size of each package by reading the .dist-info/RECORD files. This gives you the real ""logical size"" - what you'd actually see in a Docker image.
**Example output:**
```
$ pip-weigh pandas
📦 pandas (2.1.4)
├── Total Size: 138 MB
├── Self Size: 45 MB
├── Platform: linux
├── Python: 3.12
└── Dependencies (5):
├── numpy (1.26.2): 85 MB
├── pytz (2023.3): 5 MB
├── python-dateutil (2.8.2): 3 MB
└── ...

```
**Features:**
- Budget checking: `pip-weigh pandas --budget 100MB` exits with code 1 if exceeded (useful for CI)
- JSON output for scripting
- Cross-platform: check Linux package sizes from Windows/Mac
**Installation:** `pip install pip-weigh` (requires uv)
**Source:** https://github.com/muddassir-lateef/pip-weigh
## Target Audience
Developers who need to optimize Python deployments - particularly useful for:
- Docker image optimization
- AWS Lambda (250MB limit)
- CI/CD pipelines to prevent dependency bloat
It's a small side project but fully functional and published on PyPI.
## Comparison
Existing tools only show size of the packages and don't calculate total sizes with dependencies. There's no easy way to check ""how big will this be?"".
pip-weigh differs by:
- Calculating **total size including all transitive dependencies**
- Using logical file sizes (what Docker sees) instead of disk usage (which can be misleading due to uv's hardlinks)
I'd love feedback or suggestions for features. I am thinking of adding a `--compare` flag to show size differences between package versions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qpxwk1/pipweigh_a_cli_tool_to_check_the_disk_size_of/,Showcase,True,0,False,22,0.1333333333333333,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-28 21:53:47,21,Wednesday
1qps4e7,Spectrograms: A high-performance toolkit for audio and image analysis,JackG049,Python,2026-01-28T17:44:56,25,0.97,6,"I’ve released [Spectrograms](https://github.com/jmg049/Spectrograms), a library designed to provide an all-in-one pipeline for spectral analysis. It was originally built to handle the spectrogram logic for my [audio_samples](https://github.com/jmg049/audio_samples) project and was abstracted into its own toolkit to provide a more complete set of features than what is currently available in the Python ecosystem.

### What My Project Does

**Spectrograms** provides a high-performance pipeline for computing spectrograms and performing FFT-based operations on 1D signals (audio) and 2D signals (images). It supports various frequency scales (Linear, Mel, ERB, LogHz) and amplitude scales (Power, Magnitude, Decibels), alongside general-purpose 2D FFT operations for image processing like spatial filtering and convolution.

### Target Audience

This library is designed for developers and researchers requiring production-ready DSP tools. It is particularly useful for those needing batch processing efficiency, low-latency streaming support, or a Python API where metadata (like frequency/time axes) remains unified with the computation.

### Comparison

Unlike standard alternatives such as SciPy or Librosa which return raw `ndarrays`, **Spectrograms** returns context-aware objects that bundle metadata with the data. It uses a plan-based architecture implemented in Rust that releases the GIL, offering significant performance advantages in batch processing and parallel execution compared to naive NumPy-based implementations.

---

### Key Features:

* **Integrated Metadata**: Results are returned as `Spectrogram` objects rather than raw `ndarrays`. This ensures the frequency and time axes are always bundled with the data. The object maintains the parameters used for its creation and provides direct access to its `duration()`, `frequencies`, and `times`. These objects can act as drop-in replacements for `ndarrays` in most scenarios since they implement the `__array__` interface.
* **Unified API**: The library handles the full process from raw samples to scaled results. It supports `Linear`, `Mel`, `ERB`, and `LogHz` frequency scales, with amplitude scaling in `Power`, `Magnitude`, or `Decibels`. It also includes support for chromagrams, MFCCs, and general-purpose 1D and 2D FFT functions.
* **Performance via Plan Reuse**: For batch processing, the `SpectrogramPlanner` caches FFT plans and pre-computes filterbanks to avoid re-calculating constants in a loop. **Benchmarks included in the repository show this approach to be faster across tested configurations compared to standard SciPy or Librosa implementations.** The repo includes detailed benchmarks for various configurations.
* **GIL-free Execution**: The core compute is implemented in Rust and releases the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). This allows for actual parallel processing of audio batches using standard Python threading.
* **2D FFT Support**: The library includes support for 2D signals and spatial filtering for image processing using the same design philosophy as the audio tools.

### Quick Example: Linear Spectrogram

```python
import numpy as np
import spectrograms as sg

# Generate a 440 Hz test signal
sr = 16000
t = np.linspace(0, 1.0, sr)
samples = np.sin(2 * np.pi * 440.0 * t)

# Configure parameters
stft = sg.StftParams(n_fft=512, hop_size=256, window=""hanning"")
params = sg.SpectrogramParams(stft, sample_rate=sr)

# Compute linear power spectrogram
spec = sg.compute_linear_power_spectrogram(samples, params)

print(f""Frequency range: {spec.frequency_range()} Hz"")
print(f""Total duration: {spec.duration():.3f} s"")
print(f""Data shape: {spec.data.shape}"")

```

### Batch Processing with Plan Reuse

```python
planner = sg.SpectrogramPlanner()
# Pre-computes filterbanks and FFT plans once
plan = planner.mel_db_plan(params, mel_params, db_params)

# Process signals efficiently
results = [plan.compute(s) for s in signal_batch]

```

1qpm140,Oxyde: async type-safe Pydantic-centric Python ORM,mr_Fatalyst,Python,2026-01-28T13:53:44,44,0.78,32,"Hey everyone!

Sharing a project I've been working on: **Oxyde ORM**. It's an async ORM for Python with a Rust core that uses Pydantic v2 for models.

---

**GitHub:** [github.com/mr-fatalyst/oxyde](https://github.com/mr-fatalyst/oxyde)

**Docs:** [oxyde.fatalyst.dev](https://oxyde.fatalyst.dev/)

**PyPI:** `pip install oxyde`

**Version:** `0.3.1` (not production-ready)

**Benchmarks repo:** [github.com/mr-fatalyst/oxyde-benchmarks](https://github.com/mr-fatalyst/oxyde-benchmarks)

**FastAPI example:** [github.com/mr-fatalyst/fastapi-oxyde-example](https://github.com/mr-fatalyst/fastapi-oxyde-example)

---

## Why another ORM?

The main idea is a **Pydantic-centric ORM**.

Existing ORMs either have their own model system (Django, SQLAlchemy, Tortoise) or use Pydantic as a wrapper on top (SQLModel). I wanted an ORM where Pydantic v2 models are first-class citizens, not an adapter.

**What this gives you:**
- Models are regular Pydantic BaseModel with validation, serialization, type hints
- No magic with descriptors and lazy loading
- Direct FastAPI integration (models can be returned from endpoints directly)
- Data validation happens in Python (Pydantic), query execution happens in Rust

The API is Django-style because `Model.objects.filter()` is a proven UX.

---

## What My Project Does

Oxyde is an async ORM for Python with a Rust core that uses Pydantic v2 models as first-class citizens. It provides Django-style query API (`Model.objects.filter()`), supports PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite, and offers significant performance improvements through Rust-powered SQL generation and connection pooling via PyO3.

## Target Audience

This is a library for Python developers who:
- Use FastAPI or other async frameworks
- Want Pydantic models without ORM wrappers
- Need high-performance database operations
- Prefer Django-style query syntax

## Comparison

Unlike existing ORMs:
- **Django/SQLAlchemy/Tortoise**: Have their own model systems; Oxyde uses native Pydantic v2
- **SQLModel**: Uses Pydantic as a wrapper; Oxyde treats Pydantic as the primary model layer
- **No magic**: No lazy loading or descriptors — explicit `.join()` for relations

---

## Architecture

Python Layer: OxydeModel (Pydantic v2), Django-like Query DSL, AsyncDatabase

↓ MessagePack

Rust Core (PyO3): IR parsing, SQL generation (sea-query), connection pools (sqlx)

↓

PostgreSQL / SQLite / MySQL

### How it works

1. Python builds a query via DSL, producing a dict (Intermediate Representation)
2. Dict is serialized to MessagePack and passed to Rust
3. Rust deserializes IR, generates SQL via sea-query
4. sqlx executes the query, result comes back via MessagePack
5. Pydantic validates and creates model instances

---

## Benchmarks

Tested against popular ORMs: 7 ORMs x 3 databases x 24 tests.
Conditions: Docker, 2 CPU, 4GB RAM, 100 iterations, 10 warmup.

## Type safety

Oxyde generates `.pyi` files for your models.

This gives you type-safe autocomplete in your IDE.

Your IDE now knows all fields and lookups (`__gte`, `__contains`, `__in`, etc.) for each model.

---

## What's supported

### Databases
- **PostgreSQL 12+** - full support: RETURNING, UPSERT, FOR UPDATE/SHARE, JSON, Arrays
- **SQLite 3.35+** - full support: RETURNING, UPSERT, WAL mode by default
- **MySQL 8.0+** - full support: UPSERT via ON DUPLICATE KEY

---

## Limitations

1. **MySQL has no RETURNING** - uses `last_insert_id()`, which may return wrong IDs with concurrent bulk inserts.

2. **No lazy loading** - all relations are loaded via `.join()` or `.prefetch()` explicitly. This is by design, no magic.

1qqrdsb,A creative Git interface that turns your repo into a garden,Next-Job2478,Python,2026-01-29T19:19:32,0,0.25,2,"# 

Although I've been coding for many years, I only recently discovered Git at a hackathon with my friends. It immediately changed my workflow and how I wrote code. I love the functionality of Git, but the interface is sometimes hard to use and confusing. All the GUI interfaces out there are nice, but aren't very creative in the way they display the git log. That's why I've created GitGarden: an open-source CLI to visualize your git repo as ASCII art plants. GitGarden runs comfortably from your Windows terminal on any repo you want.

\*\*What it does\*\*

The program currently supports 4 plant types that dynamically adapt to the size of your repo. The art is animated and procedurally generated with many colors to choose from for each plant type. I plan to add more features in the future!

It works by parsing the repo and finding all relevant data from git, like commits, parents, etc. Then it determines the length or the commit list, which in turn determines what type of plant will populate your garden. Each type of plant is dynamic and the size adapts to fit your repo so the art looks continuous. The colors are randomized and the ASCII characters are animated as they print out in your terminal.

\*\*Target Audience\*\*

Intended for coders like me who depend on Git but can't find any good interfaces out there. GitGarden makes learning Git seem less intimidating and confusing, so it's perfect for beginners. Really, it's just made for anyone who wants to add a splash a color to their terminal while they code :).

\*\*Comparison\*\*

There are other Git interfaces out there. But, none of them add the same whimsy to your terminal as my project does. Most of them are focused on simplifying the commit process, but GitGarden creates a more full environment where you can view all your Git information and code commits.

1qqesv3,Built a tool that rewrites your code when upgrading dependencies - looking for feedback,bolation123,Python,2026-01-29T11:21:42,0,0.4,5,"I have been working on a project over the past few weeks to automatically migrate packages to the newest version.

**What My Project Does**

Codeshift is a CLI that scans your codebase for outdated dependencies and actually rewrites your code to work with newer versions. It uses libcst for AST transforms on common patterns (so no LLM needed for the straightforward stuff like .dict() → .model\_dump()), and falls back to an LLM for trickier migrations. Right now it has a knowledge base of 15 popular packages including Pydantic, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Requests.

**Target Audience**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Anyone who's put off upgrading a dependency because they didn't want to manually fix hundreds of breaking changes. I built this for my own projects but it should be useful for anyone dealing with major version migrations.

**Comparison**

Most tools just bump your version numbers (like pip-tools, poetry update) or tell you what's outdated. Codeshift actually modifies your source code to match the new API. The closest thing is

probably Facebook's codemod/libcst, but that requires you to write your own transforms - this comes with them built in.

Looking for feedback on the tool and what you would like to see added to it!

1qpodct,Event-driven CQRS framework with Saga and Outbox,vadikko2-404,Python,2026-01-28T15:19:48,7,0.83,1,"I\`ve been working on python-cqrs an event-driven CQRS framework for Python, and wanted to share a quick use case overview.

**What My Project Does:**

Commands and queries go through a Mediator; handlers are bound by type, so you get clear separation of read/write and easy testing. Domain events from handlers are collected and sent via an event emitter to Kafka (or another broker) after the request is handled.

**Killer features I use most:**

* **Saga pattern**: Multi-step workflows with automatic compensation on failure, persisted state, and recovery so you can resume interrupted sagas. Good for reserve inventory charge payment ship style flows.
* **Fallback + Circuit Breaker:** Wrap saga steps in *Fallback(step=Primary, fallback=Backup, circuit\_breaker=...)* so when the primary step keeps failing, the fallback runs and the circuit limits retries.
* **Transactional Outbox**: Write events to an outbox in the same DB transaction as your changes; a separate process publishes to Kafka. At-least-once delivery without losing events if the broker is down.
* **FastAPI / FastStream:** *mediator = fastapi.Depends(mediator\_factory)*, then *await mediator.send(SomeCommand(...))*. Same idea for FastStream: consume from Kafka and *await event\_mediator.send(event)* to dispatch to handlers. No heavy glue code.

Also in the box: **EventMediator** for events consumed from the bus, **StreamingRequestMediator** for SSE/progress, **Chain of Responsibility** for request pipelines, optional **Protobuf** events, and **Mermaid** diagram generation from saga/CoR definitions.

**Target Audience**

1. Backend engineers building event-driven or microservice systems in Python.
2. Teams that need distributed transactions (multi-step flows with compensation) and reliable event publishing (Outbox).
3. Devs already using FastAPI or FastStream who want CQRS/EDA without a lot of custom plumbing.
4. Anyone designing event sourcing, read models, or eventual consistency and looking for a single framework that ties mediator, sagas, outbox, and broker integration together.

1qq6ou3,LinuxWhisper – A native AI Voice Assistant built with PyGObject and Groq,[deleted],Python,2026-01-29T06:00:43,0,0.5,3,"**What My Project Does** LinuxWhisper is a lightweight voice-to-text and AI assistant layer for Linux desktops. It uses `PyGObject` (GTK3) for an overlay UI and `sounddevice` for audio. By connecting to Groq’s APIs (Whisper/Llama), it provides near-instant latency for global tasks:

* **Dictation (F3)**: Real-time transcription typed directly at your cursor.
* **Smart Rewrite (F7)**: Highlight text, speak an instruction, and the tool replaces the selection with the AI-edited version.
* **Vision (F8)**: Captures a screenshot and provides AI analysis based on your voice query.
* **TTS Support**: Integrated text-to-speech for AI responses.

**Target Audience** This project is intended for Linux power users who want a privacy-conscious, hackable alternative to mainstream assistants. It is currently a functional ""Prosumer"" tool—more than a toy, but designed for users who are comfortable setting up an API key.

**Comparison** Unlike heavy Electron-based AI wrappers or browser extensions, LinuxWhisper is a native Python application (\~1500 LOC) that interacts directly with the X11/Wayland window system via `xdotool` and `pyperclip`. It focuses on ""low-latency utility"" rather than a complex chat interface, making it feel like a part of the OS rather than a separate app.

1qpln9j,Introducing the mkdocs-editor-notes plugin,dusktreader,Python,2026-01-28T13:39:52,6,0.81,0,"# Background

I found myself wanting to be able to add editorial notes for myself and easily track what I had left to do in my docs site. Unfortunately, I didn't find any of the solutions for my problem very satisfying. So, I built a plugin to track editorial notes in my MkDocs sites without cluttering things up.

I wrote a blog post about it [on my blog](https://blog.dusktreader.dev/2026/01/28/introducing-mkdocs-editor-notes-keep-your-documentation-clean-while-tracking-todos/).

Feedback, issues, and ideas welcome!

# What my Project Does

[mkdocs-editor-notes](https://github.com/dusktreader/mkdocs-editor-notes) uses footnote-like syntax to let you add editorial notes that get collected into a single tracker page:

    This feature needs more work[^todo:add-examples].
    
    [^todo:add-examples]: Add error handling examples and edge cases

The notes are hidden from readers (or visible if you want), and the plugin auto-generates an ""/editor-notes/"" page with all your TODOs, questions, and improvement ideas linked back to the exact paragraphs.

Available on PyPI:

    pip install mkdocs-editor-notes

# Target Audience

Developers who write software docs using MkDocs

# Comparison

I didn't find any other plugins that offer the same functionality. I wrote a section about [""What I've tried""](https://blog.dusktreader.dev/2026/01/28/introducing-mkdocs-editor-notes-keep-your-documentation-clean-while-tracking-todos/#what-ive-tried) on the blog post.

1qp6smf,"I built a Python IDE that runs completely in your browser (no login, fully local)",Regular-Entrance-205,Python,2026-01-28T03:29:42,35,0.62,74,"I've been working on this browser-based Python compiler and just want to share it in case anyone finds it useful: [https://pythoncompiler.io](https://pythoncompiler.io/)

What's different about it:

First of all, Everything runs in your browser. Your code literally never touches a server. It has a nice UI, responsive and fast, hope you like it.. Besides, has some good features as well:

\- Supports regular code editor + ipynb notebooks (you can upload your notebook and start working as well)

\- Works with Data science packages like pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scikit-learn etc.

\- Can install PyPI packages on the fly with a button click.

\- Multiple files/tabs support

\- Export your notebooks to nicely formatted PDF or HTML (this is very handy personally).

\- Super fast and saves your work every 2 seconds, so your work wont be lost even if you refresh the page.

Why I built it:

People use python use online IDEs a lot but they are way too simple. Been using it myself for quick tests and teaching. Figured I'd share in case it's useful to anyone else. All client-side, so your code stays private.

Would love any feedback or suggestions! Thanks in advance.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1qp6smf/i_built_a_python_ide_that_runs_completely_in_your/,Discussion,True,0,False,109,0.25325757575757574,positive,2026-02-03T09:44:56.697758,2026-01-28 03:29:42,3,Wednesday
